(looking up at the psychiatrist with a hint of sadness) sometimes I just feel overwhelmed.\\n\\nPsychiatrist: Okay, Ashley. Let's talk about your social interactions. Do you have many friends or relationships outside of your family?\\n\\nMe: (looking down again) Not really. My sisters are my best friends, but...
