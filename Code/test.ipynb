She was recently found to\\n\\n have Kleefstra syndrome, and the family wanted to reconfirm the earlier diagnoses and\\n\\n assess the genetic risk to the future children of her older sisters.\\n\\n At the time of the reevaluation, Ashley was attending a special school with a focus on\\n\\n functional skills. She was able to dress herself, but she was not able to shower\\n\\n independently or be left alone in the house. She was able to decode (e.g., read words)\\n\\n and spell at a second-grade level but understood little of what she read. Changes to her\\n\\n schedule and heightened functional expectations tended to make her irritable. When\\n\\n upset, Ashley would often hurt herself (e.g., biting her wrist) and others (e.g., pinching\\n\\n and hair pulling).\\n\\n In formal testing done at the time of the reevaluation, Ashley had a nonverbal IQ of 39\\n\\n and a verbal IQ of 23, with a full scale IQ of 31. Her adaptive scores were somewhat\\n\\n higher, with an overall score of 42 (with 100 as average).\\n\\n By history, Ashley first received services at age 9 months after her parents noticed\\n\\n significant motor delays. She walked at 20 months and was toilet trained at 5 years. She\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n##### spoke her first word at age 6. She received a diagnosis of developmental delay at age 3\\n\\n and of autism, obesity, and static encephalopathy at age 4. An early evaluation noted\\n\\n possible facial dysmorphology; genetic tests at that time were noncontributory.\\n\\n Her parents indicated that Ashley knew hundreds of single words and many simple\\n\\n phrases. She had long been very interested in license plates and would draw them for\\n\\n hours. Her strongest skill was memory, and she could draw precise representations of\\n\\n license plates from different states. Ashley had always been very attached to her parents\\n\\n and sisters, and although affectionate toward babies, she showed minimal interest in\\n\\n other teenagers.\\n\\n Ashley’s family history was pertinent for a father with dyslexia, a paternal uncle with\\n\\n epilepsy, and a maternal male cousin with possible “Asperger’s syndrome.” Her siblings,\\n\\n both sisters, were in college and doing well.\\n\\n On examination, Ashley was an overweight young woman who made inconsistent eye\\n\\n contact but often peered out the corner of her eye. She had a beautiful smile and would\\n\\n sometimes laugh to herself, but most of the time her facial expressions were subdued.\\n\\n She did not initiate joint attention by trying to catch another person’s eyes. She\\n\\n frequently ignored what others would say to her. To request a preferred object (e.g., a\\n\\n shiny magazine), Ashley would rock from foot to foot and point. When offered an object\\n\\n (e.g., a small decorated box), she brought it to her nose and lips for inspection. Ashley\\n\\n spoke in a high-pitched voice with unusual intonation. During the interview, she used\\n\\n multiple words and a few short phrases that were somewhat rote but communicative,\\n\\n such as “I want to clean up,” and “Do you have a van?”\\n\\n In the months prior to the evaluation, Ashley’s parents noticed that she had become\\n\\n increasingly apathetic. A medical evaluation concluded that urinary tract infections were\\n\\n the most likely cause for her symptoms, but antibiotics seemed only to make her more\\n\\n listless. Further medical evaluation led to more extensive genetic testing, and Ashley was\\n\\n diagnosed with Kleefstra syndrome, a rare genetic defect associated with multiple\\n\\n medical problems, including intellectual developmental disorder.

She was recently found to\\n\\n have Kleefstra syndrome, and the family wanted to reconfirm the earlier diagnoses and\\n\\n assess the genetic risk to the future children of her older sisters.\\n\\n At the time of the reevaluation, Ashley was attending a special school with a focus on\\n\\n functional skills. She was able to dress herself, but she was not able to shower\\n\\n independently or be left alone in the house. She was able to decode (e.g., read words)\\n\\n and spell at a second-grade level but understood little of what she read. Changes to her\\n\\n schedule and heightened functional expectations tended to make her irritable. When\\n\\n upset, Ashley would often hurt herself (e.g., biting her wrist) and others (e.g., pinching\\n\\n and hair pulling).\\n\\n In formal testing done at the time of the reevaluation, Ashley had a nonverbal IQ of 39\\n\\n and a verbal IQ of 23, with a full scale IQ of 31. Her adaptive scores were somewhat\\n\\n higher, with an overall score of 42 (with 100 as average).\\n\\n By history, Ashley first received services at age 9 months after her parents noticed\\n\\n significant motor delays. She walked at 20 months and was toilet trained at 5 years. She\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n##### spoke her first word at age 6. She received a diagnosis of developmental delay at age 3\\n\\n and of autism, obesity, and static encephalopathy at age 4. An early evaluation noted\\n\\n possible facial dysmorphology; genetic tests at that time were noncontributory.\\n\\n Her parents indicated that Ashley knew hundreds of single words and many simple\\n\\n phrases. She had long been very interested in license plates and would draw them for\\n\\n hours. Her strongest skill was memory, and she could draw precise representations of\\n\\n license plates from different states. Ashley had always been very attached to her parents\\n\\n and sisters, and although affectionate toward babies, she showed minimal interest in\\n\\n other teenagers.\\n\\n Ashley’s family history was pertinent for a father with dyslexia, a paternal uncle with\\n\\n epilepsy, and a maternal male cousin with possible “Asperger’s syndrome.” Her siblings,\\n\\n both sisters, were in college and doing well.\\n\\n On examination, Ashley was an overweight young woman who made inconsistent eye\\n\\n contact but often peered out the corner of her eye. She had a beautiful smile and would\\n\\n sometimes laugh to herself, but most of the time her facial expressions were subdued.\\n\\n She did not initiate joint attention by trying to catch another person’s eyes. She\\n\\n frequently ignored what others would say to her. To request a preferred object (e.g., a\\n\\n shiny magazine), Ashley would rock from foot to foot and point. When offered an object\\n\\n (e.g., a small decorated box), she brought it to her nose and lips for inspection. Ashley\\n\\n spoke in a high-pitched voice with unusual intonation.
