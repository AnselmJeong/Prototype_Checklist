{"Intellectual Developmental Disorder (Intellectual Disability)": {"code": null, "criteria": "Intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability) is a disorder with onset during the developmental period that includes both intellectual and adaptive functioning deficits in conceptual, social, and practical domains. The following three criteria must be met:\nA. Deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience, confirmed by both clinical assessment and individualized, standardized intelligence testing.\nB. Deficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet developmental and sociocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongoing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life, such as communication, social participation, and independent living, across multiple environments, such as home, school, work, and community.\nC. Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental period.\nNote: The term intellectual developmental disorder is used to clarify its relationship with the WHO ICD-11 classification system, which uses the term Disorders of Intellectual Development. The equivalent term intellectual disability is placed in parentheses for continued use. The medical and research literature use both terms, while intellectual disability is the term in common use by educational and other professions, advocacy groups, and the lay public. In the United States, Public Law 111-256 (Rosa\u2019s Law) changed all references to \u201cmental retardation\u201d in federal laws to \u201cintellectual disability.\u201d Specify current severity (see Table 1):\nF70 Mild\nF71 Moderate F72 Severe\nF73 Profound\nTABLE 1 Severity levels for intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual\ndisability)\nSeverity\nlevel\nConceptual domain\nSocial domain\nPractical domain\nMild\nFor preschool children, there may be Compared with typically developing The individual may function age-\nModerate\nSevere\nno obvious conceptual differences. For school-age children and adults, there are difficulties in learning academic skills involving reading, writing, arithmetic, time, or money, with support needed in one or more areas to meet age-related expectations. In adults, abstract thinking, executive function (i.e., planning, strategizing, priority setting, and cognitive flexibility), and short-term memory, as well as functional use of academic skills (e.g., reading, money management), are impaired. There is a somewhat concrete approach to problems and solutions compared with age-mates.\nAll through development, the\nindividual\u2019s conceptual skills lag markedly behind those of peers. For preschoolers, language and preacademic skills develop slowly. For school-age children, progress in reading, writing, mathematics, and understanding of time and money occurs slowly across the school years and is markedly limited compared with that of peers. For adults, academic skill development is typically at an elementary level, and support is required for all use of academic skills in work and personal life. Ongoing assistance on a daily basis is needed to complete conceptual tasks of day-to-day life, and others may take over these responsibilities fully for the individual.\nAttainment of conceptual skills is\nlimited. The individual generally has little understanding of written language or of concepts involving numbers, quantity, time, and\nage-mates, the individual is immature in social interactions. For example, there may be difficulty in accurately perceiving peers\u2019 social cues. Communication, conversation, and language are more concrete or immature than expected for age. There may be difficulties regulating emotion and behavior in age-appropriate fashion; these difficulties are noticed by peers in social situations. There is limited understanding of risk in social situations; social judgment is immature for age, and the person is at risk of being manipulated by others (gullibility).\nThe individual shows marked\ndifferences from peers in social and communicative behavior across development. Spoken language is typically a primary tool for social communication but is much less complex than that of peers. Capacity for relationships is evident in ties to family and friends, and the individual may have successful friendships across life and sometimes romantic relations in adulthood. However, individuals may not perceive or interpret social cues accurately. Social judgment and decision- making abilities are limited, and caretakers must assist the person with life decisions. Friendships with typically developing peers are often affected by communication or social limitations. Significant social and communicative support is needed in work settings for success.\nSpoken language is quite limited in\nterms of vocabulary and grammar. Speech may be single words or phrases and may be supplemented through augmentative means.\nappropriately in personal care. Individuals need some support with complex daily living tasks in comparison to peers. In adulthood, supports typically involve grocery shopping, transportation, home and child-care organizing, nutritious food preparation, and banking and money management. Recreational skills resemble those of age-mates, although judgment related to well-being and organization around recreation requires support. In adulthood, competitive employment is often seen in jobs that do not emphasize conceptual skills. Individuals generally need support to make health care decisions and legal decisions, and to learn to perform a skilled vocation competently. Support is typically needed to raise a family.\nThe individual can care for personal needs involving eating, dressing, elimination, and hygiene as an adult, although an extended period of teaching and time is needed for the individual to become independent in these areas, and reminders may be needed. Similarly, participation in all household tasks can be achieved by adulthood, although an extended period of teaching is needed, and ongoing supports will typically occur for adult-level performance. Independent employment in jobs that require limited conceptual and communication skills can be achieved, but considerable support from coworkers, supervisors, and others is needed to manage social expectations, job complexities, and ancillary responsibilities such as scheduling, transportation, health benefits, and money management. A variety of recreational skills can be developed. These typically require additional supports and learning opportunities over an extended period of time. Maladaptive behavior is present in a significant minority and causes social problems.\nThe individual requires support for all activities of daily living, including meals, dressing, bathing, and elimination. The individual requires supervision at all times.\nmoney. Caretakers provide extensive supports for problem solving throughout life.\nSpeech and communication are focused on the here and now within everyday events. Language is used for social communication more than for explication. Individuals understand simple speech and gestural communication. Relationships with family members and familiar others are a source of pleasure and help.\nThe individual cannot make responsible decisions regarding well-being of self or others. In adulthood, participation in tasks at home, recreation, and work requires ongoing support and assistance. Skill acquisition in all domains involves long-term teaching and ongoing support. Maladaptive behavior, including self-injury, is present in a significant minority.\nProfound\nConceptual skills generally involve the physical world rather than symbolic processes. The individual may use objects in goal-directed fashion for self-care, work, and recreation. Certain visuospatial skills, such as matching and sorting based on physical characteristics, may be acquired. However, co-occurring motor and sensory impairments may prevent functional use of objects.\nThe individual has very limited understanding of symbolic communication in speech or gesture. He or she may understand some simple instructions or gestures. The individual expresses his or her own desires and emotions largely through nonverbal, nonsymbolic communication. The individual enjoys relationships with well- known family members, caretakers, and familiar others, and initiates and responds to social interactions through gestural and emotional cues. Co-occurring sensory and physical impairments may prevent many social activities.\nThe individual is dependent on others for all aspects of daily physical care, health, and safety, although he or she may be able to participate in some of these activities as well. Individuals without severe physical impairments may assist with some daily work tasks at home, like carrying dishes to the table. Simple actions with objects may be the basis of participation in some vocational activities with high levels of ongoing support. Recreational activities may involve, for example, enjoyment in listening to music, watching movies, going out for walks, or participating in water activities, all with the support of others. Co- occurring physical and sensory impairments are frequent barriers to participation (beyond watching) in home, recreational, and vocational activities. Maladaptive behavior is present in a significant minority.\nSpecifiers The various levels of severity are defined on the basis of adaptive functioning, and not IQ scores, because it is adaptive functioning that determines the level of supports required. Moreover, IQ measures are less valid in the lower end of the IQ range."}, "Language Disorder": {"code": "F80.2", "criteria": "A.

Difficulty initiating social interactions, and clear examples of atypical or unsuccessful responses to social overtures of others. May appear to have decreased interest in social interactions. For example, a person who is able to speak in full sentences and engages in communication but whose to-and-fro conversation with others fails, and whose attempts to make friends are odd and typically unsuccessful.\nInflexibility of behavior causes significant interference with functioning in one or more contexts. Difficulty switching between activities. Problems of organization and planning hamper independence.\nRecording Procedures It may be helpful to note level of support needed for each of the two core psychopathological domains in Table 2 (e.g., \u201crequiring very substantial support for deficits in social communication and requiring substantial support for restricted, repetitive behaviors\u201d). Specification of \u201cwith accompanying intellectual impairment\u201d or \u201cwithout accompanying\nintellectual impairment\u201d should be recorded next. Language impairment specification should be recorded thereafter. If there is accompanying language impairment, the current level of verbal functioning should be recorded (e.g., \u201cwith accompanying language impairment\u2014no intelligible speech\u201d or \u201cwith accompanying language impairment\u2014phrase speech\u201d).\nFor autism spectrum disorder for which the specifiers \u201cassociated with a known genetic or other medical condition or environmental factor\u201d or \u201cassociated with a neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral problem\u201d are appropriate, record autism spectrum disorder associated with (name of condition, disorder, or factor) (e.g., autism spectrum disorder associated with tuberous sclerosis complex). These specifiers apply to presentations in which the listed condition or problem is potentially relevant to the clinical care of the individual and do not necessarily indicate that the condition or problem is causally related to the autism spectrum disorder. If the associated neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral problem meets criteria for a neurodevelopmental or other mental disorder, both autism spectrum disorder and the other disorder should be diagnosed.\nIf catatonia is present, record separately \u201ccatatonia associated with autism spectrum disorder.\u201d For more information, see criteria for catatonia associated with another mental disorder in the chapter \u201cSchizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders.\u201d\nSpecifiers The severity specifiers (see Table 2) may be used to describe succinctly the current symptomatology (which might fall below level 1), with the recognition that severity may vary by context and fluctuate over time. Severity of social communication difficulties and restricted, repetitive behaviors should be separately rated. The descriptive severity categories should not be used to determine eligibility for and provision of services. Indeed, individuals with relatively better skills overall may experience different or even greater psychosocial challenges. Thus, service needs can only be developed at an individual level and through discussion of personal priorities and targets.\nimpairment,\u201d understanding the (often uneven) intellectual profile of a child or adult with autism spectrum disorder is necessary for interpreting diagnostic features. Separate estimates of verbal and nonverbal skill are necessary (e.g., using untimed nonverbal tests to assess potential strengths in individuals with limited language).\nRegarding\nthe specifier \u201cwith or without accompanying\nintellectual\nTo use the specifier \u201cwith or without accompanying language impairment,\u201d the current level of verbal functioning should be assessed and described. Examples of the specific descriptions for \u201cwith accompanying language impairment\u201d might include no intelligible speech (nonverbal), single words only, or phrase speech. Language level in individuals \u201cwithout accompanying language impairment\u201d might be further described as speaks in full sentences or has fluent speech. Since receptive language may lag behind expressive language development in autism spectrum disorder, receptive and expressive language skills should be considered separately.\nThe specifier \u201cassociated with a known genetic or other medical condition or environmental factor\u201d can be applied when an individual has a known genetic condition (e.g., Rett syndrome, fragile X syndrome, Down syndrome), a known medical condition (e.g., epilepsy), or a history of environmental exposure in utero to a known teratogen or infection (e.g., fetal valproate syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal rubella). This specifier should not be viewed as synonymous with causation of autism spectrum disorder. A condition may be listed as being associated with autism spectrum disorder when it is thought to be potentially clinically relevant or inform care and not because the clinician is asserting a cause. Examples include autism spectrum disorder associated with a unique genomic copy number variant that could be clinically relevant even if the specific abnormality may not have directly caused nor have previously been linked to autism spectrum disorder, or Crohn\u2019s disease, which could exacerbate behavioral symptoms.\nThe specifier \u201cassociated with a neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral problem\u201d can be applied to indicate problems (e.g., irritability, sleep problems, self-injurious behavior, or developmental regression) that contribute to the functional formulation or are a focus of treatment. Additional neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral disorders should also be noted as separate diagnoses (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; developmental coordination disorder; disruptive behavior, impulse-control, and conduct disorders; anxiety, depressive, or bipolar disorders; tics or Tourette\u2019s disorder; feeding, elimination, or sleep disorders).\nCatatonia can occur as a comorbid condition with autism spectrum disorder. In addition to classic symptoms of posturing, negativism (opposition or no response to instructions or external stimuli), mutism, and stupor, an increase or worsening of stereotypy and self-injurious behavior may form part of the symptom complex of catatonia in the setting of autism spectrum disorder."}, "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder": {"code": null, "criteria": "A.

For example, in the case of delusions occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is F14.259 severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced psychotic disorder, with onset during intoxication.

Coding note: The ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medication]-induced bipolar and related disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10- CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. In any case, an additional separate diagnosis of a substance use disorder is not given. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder, the 4th position character is \u201c1,\u201d and the clinician should record \u201cmild [substance] use disorder\u201d before the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder (e.g., \u201cmild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced bipolar and related disorder\u201d). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder, the 4th position character is \u201c2,\u201d and the clinician should record \u201cmoderate [substance] use disorder\u201d or \u201csevere [substance] use disorder,\u201d depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is \u201c9,\u201d and the clinician should record only the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder.\nICD-10-CM\nWith mild use disorder\nWith moderate or severe use disorder\nWithout use disorder\nAlcohol\nPhencyclidine\nOther hallucinogen\nSedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic\nAmphetamine-type substance (or other stimulant) Cocaine\nOther (or unknown) substance\nSpecify (see Table 1 in the chapter \u201cSubstance-Related and Addictive Disorders,\u201d which indicates whether \u201cwith onset during intoxication\u201d and/or \u201cwith onset during withdrawal\u201d applies to a given substance class; or specify \u201cwith onset after medication use\u201d):\nWith onset during intoxication: If criteria are met for intoxication with the substance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.\nWith onset during withdrawal: If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.\nWith onset after medication use: If symptoms developed at initiation of medication, with a change in use of medication, or during withdrawal of medication.\nRecording Procedures The name of the substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the bipolar mood symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for \u201cother (or unknown) substance\u201d should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the same code should also be used.\nWhen recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word \u201cwith,\u201d followed by the name of the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder, followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). For example, in the case of irritable symptoms occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is F14.24 severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxication. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one- time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F15.94 amphetamine-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of bipolar mood symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., F15.24 severe methylphenidate use disorder with methylphenidate-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxication; F19.94 dexamethasone-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxication)."}, "Bipolar and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition": {"code": null, "criteria": "A.

The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for \u201cother (or unknown) substance\u201d should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the same code should also be used.\nWhen recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word \u201cwith,\u201d followed by the name of the substance-induced depressive disorder, followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). For example, in the case of depressive symptoms occurring during withdrawal in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is F14.24 severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced depressive disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F16.94 phencyclidine-induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of depressive\nmood symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., F15.24 severe methylphenidate use disorder with methylphenidate-induced depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal; F19.94 dexamethasone-induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication)."}, "Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition": {"code": null, "criteria": "A.

Insight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs can range from good to absent/delusional (i.e., delusional beliefs consisting of complete conviction that the individual\u2019s view of his or her appearance is accurate and undistorted). On average, insight is poor, and one-third or more of individuals currently have absent insight/delusional body dysmorphic disorder beliefs.

Coding note: The ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medication]-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. In any case, an additional separate diagnosis of a substance use disorder is not given. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, the 4th position character is \u201c1,\u201d and the clinician should record \u201cmild [substance] use disorder\u201d before the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (e.g., \u201cmild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced obsessive- compulsive and related disorder\u201d). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, the 4th position character is \u201c2,\u201d and the clinician should record \u201cmoderate [substance] use disorder\u201d or \u201csevere [substance] use disorder,\u201d depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is \u201c9,\u201d and the clinician should record only the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder.\nICD-10-CM\nWith mild use disorder\nWith moderate or severe use disorder\nWithout use disorder\nAmphetamine-type substance (or other stimulant) Cocaine\nOther (or unknown) substance\nSpecify (see Table 1 in the chapter \u201cSubstance-Related and Addictive Disorders,\u201d which indicates whether \u201cwith onset during intoxication\u201d and/or \u201cwith onset during withdrawal\u201d applies to a given substance class; or specify \u201cwith onset after medication use\u201d):\nWith onset during intoxication: If criteria are met for intoxication with the substance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.\nWith onset during withdrawal: If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.\nWith onset after medication use: If symptoms developed at initiation of medication, with a change in use of medication, or during withdrawal of medication.\nRecording Procedures The name of the substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine) that is presumed to be causing the obsessive- compulsive and related symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., ropinirole), the code for \u201cother (or unknown) substance\u201d should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the same code should also be used.\nTo record the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by \u201cwith substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder\u201d (incorporating the name of the specific etiological substance/medication), followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset after medication use). For example, in the case of repetitive skin-picking occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is F14.288 severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, with onset during intoxication. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F15.988 amphetamine-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, with onset during intoxication).

Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. In any case, an additional separate diagnosis of a substance use disorder is not given. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sleep disorder, the 4th position character is \u201c1,\u201d and the clinician should record \u201cmild [substance] use disorder\u201d before the substance-induced sleep disorder (e.g., \u201cmild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced sleep disorder\u201d). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sleep disorder, the 4th position character is \u201c2,\u201d and the clinician should record \u201cmoderate [substance] use disorder\u201d or \u201csevere [substance] use disorder,\u201d depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is \u201c9,\u201d and the clinician should record only the substance-induced sleep disorder. There are two exceptions to this coding convention as it applies to caffeine- and tobacco-induced sleep disorders. Because caffeine use disorder is not an official DSM-5 category,\nthere is only a single ICD-10-CM code for caffeine-induced sleep disorder: F15.982. Moreover, because ICD-10-CM assumes that tobacco-induced sleep disorder can only occur in the context of moderate or severe tobacco use disorder, the ICD-10- CM code for tobacco-induced sleep disorder is F17.208.\nICD-10-CM\nWith mild use disorder\nWith moderate or severe use disorder\nWithout use disorder\nAlcohol\nCaffeine\nNA\nNA\nCannabis\nOpioid\nSedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic\nAmphetamine-type substance (or other stimulant) Cocaine\nTobacco\nNA\nNA\nOther (or unknown) substance\nSpecify whether:\nInsomnia type: Characterized by difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, or nonrestorative sleep.\nDaytime sleepiness type: Characterized by predominant complaint of\nexcessive sleepiness/fatigue during waking hours or, less commonly, a long sleep period.\nParasomnia type: Characterized by abnormal behavioral events during sleep.\nMixed type: Characterized by a substance/medication-induced sleep problem characterized by multiple types of sleep symptoms, but no symptom clearly predominates.\nSpecify (see Table 1 in the chapter \u201cSubstance-Related and Addictive Disorders,\u201d which indicates whether \u201cwith onset during intoxication\u201d and/or \u201cwith onset during withdrawal\u201d applies to a given substance class; or specify \u201cwith onset after medication use\u201d):\nWith onset during intoxication: If criteria are met for intoxication with the substance and the symptoms develop during the intoxication.\nWith onset during withdrawal: If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.\nWith onset after medication use: If symptoms developed at initiation of medication, with a change in use of medication, or during withdrawal of medication.\nRecording Procedures The name of the substance/medication-induced sleep disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., alcohol) that is presumed to be causing the sleep disturbance. The ICD-10-CM code that corresponds to the applicable drug class is selected from the table included in the criteria set. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., fluoxetine), the ICD-10-CM code for the other (or unknown) substance class should be used and the name\nof the specific substance recorded (e.g., F19.982 fluoxetine-induced sleep disorder, insomnia type). In cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific substance is unknown, the ICD-10-CM code for the other (or unknown) substance class is used and the fact that the substance is unknown is recorded (e.g., F19.982 unknown substance- induced sleep disorder, hypersomnia type).\nTo record the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by \u201cwith substance/medication-induced sleep disorder\u201d (incorporating the name of the specific etiological substance/medication), followed by the specification of onset (i.e., with onset during intoxication, with onset during withdrawal, with onset after medication use), followed by the subtype designation (i.e., insomnia type, daytime sleepiness type, parasomnia type, mixed type). For example, in the case of insomnia occurring during withdrawal in a man with a severe lorazepam use disorder, the diagnosis is F13.282 severe lorazepam use disorder with lorazepam-induced sleep disorder, with onset during withdrawal, insomnia type. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe lorazepam use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced sleep disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., with medication use as\nprescribed), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F19.982 bupropion-induced sleep disorder, with onset during medication use, insomnia type). When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of the sleep disturbance, each should be listed separately (e.g., F10.282 severe alcohol use disorder with alcohol-induced sleep disorder, with onset during intoxication, insomnia type; F14.282 severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine- induced sleep disorder, with onset during intoxication, insomnia type).\nSpecifiers Depending on the substance involved, one of four types of sleep disturbances is indicated. Insomnia type and daytime sleepiness type are most common, whereas parasomnia type is seen less often.

Such evidence of an dysfunction could include the following:\nThe symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence non- existence substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes).\nsuggesting\nthe\nof\nan\nindependent\nD. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress in the individual.\nNote: This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention. Coding note: The ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medication]-induced sexual dysfunctions are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. In any case, an additional separate diagnosis of a substance use disorder is not given. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sexual dysfunction, the 4th position character is \u201c1,\u201d and the clinician should record \u201cmild [substance] use disorder\u201d before the substance- induced sexual dysfunction (e.g., \u201cmild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced sexual dysfunction\u201d). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sexual dysfunction, the 4th position character is \u201c2,\u201d and the clinician should record \u201cmoderate [substance] use disorder\u201d or \u201csevere [substance] use disorder,\u201d depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is \u201c9,\u201d and the clinician should record only the substance-induced sexual dysfunction.\nICD-10-CM\nWith mild use disorder\nWith moderate or severe use disorder\nWithout use disorder\nAlcohol\nOpioid\nSedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic\nAmphetamine-type substance (or other stimulant) Cocaine\nOther (or unknown) substance\nSpecify (see Table 1 in the chapter \u201cSubstance-Related and Addictive Disorders,\u201d which indicates whether \u201cwith onset during intoxication\u201d and/or \u201cwith onset during withdrawal\u201d applies to a given substance class; or specify \u201cwith onset after medication use\u201d):\nWith onset during intoxication: If criteria are met for intoxication with the substance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.\nWith onset during withdrawal: If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.\nWith onset after medication use: If symptoms developed at initiation of medication, with a change in use of medication, or during withdrawal of medication.\nSpecify current severity:\nMild: Occurs on 25%\u201350% of occasions of sexual activity.\nModerate: Occurs on 50%\u201375% of occasions of sexual activity.\nSevere: Occurs on 75% or more of occasions of sexual activity.\nRecording Procedures The name of the substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction begins with the specific substance (e.g., alcohol) that is presumed to be causing the sexual dysfunction. The ICD-10-CM code that corresponds to the applicable drug class is selected from the table included in the criteria set. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., fluoxetine), the ICD-10- CM code for the other (or unknown) substance class should be used and the name of the specific substance recorded (e.g., F19.981 fluoxetine-induced sexual dysfunction). In cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific substance is unknown, the ICD-10- CM code for the other (or unknown) substance class is used and the fact that the substance is unknown is recorded (e.g., F19.981 unknown substance-induced sexual dysfunction).\nWhen recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word \u201cwith,\u201d followed by the name of the substance-induced sexual dysfunction, followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset after medication use), followed by the severity specifier (e.g., mild, moderate, severe). For example, in the case of erectile dysfunction occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is F10.281 severe alcohol use disorder with alcohol-induced sexual dysfunction, with onset during intoxication, moderate. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe alcohol use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced sexual dysfunction occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F15.981 amphetamine-induced sexual dysfunction, with onset during intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of the sexual dysfunction, each should be listed separately (e.g., F14.181 mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced sexual dysfunction, with onset during intoxication, moderate; F19.981 fluoxetine-induced sexual dysfunction, with onset after medication use, moderate)."}, "Gender Dysphoria": {"code": "F64.0", "criteria": "Gender Dysphoria in Children\nA.

Note that the etiological medical condition both appears as a separate code that precedes the delirium code and is substituted into the delirium due to another medical condition rubric.\nRecording Procedures Substance intoxication delirium.\nThe name of the substance intoxication delirium begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine) that is presumed to be causing the delirium. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for \u201cother substance\u201d should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category \u201cunknown substance\u201d should be used.\nWhen recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word \u201cwith,\u201d followed by the name of the substance intoxication delirium, followed by the course (i.e., acute, persistent), followed by the specifier indicating level of psychomotor activity (i.e., hyperactive, hypoactive, mixed level of activity). For example, in the case of acute hyperactive intoxication delirium occurring in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is F14.221 severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine intoxication delirium, acute, hyperactive. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the intoxication delirium occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g.,\nF16.921 phencyclidine intoxication delirium, acute, hypoactive).\nSubstance withdrawal delirium.\nThe name of the substance withdrawal delirium begins with the specific substance (e.g., alcohol) that is presumed to be causing the withdrawal delirium. The diagnostic code is selected from substance-specific codes in the coding note included in the criteria set. When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word \u201cwith,\u201d followed by the substance withdrawal delirium, followed by the course (i.e., acute, persistent), followed by the specifier indicating level of psychomotor activity (i.e., hyperactive, hypoactive, mixed level of activity). For example, in the case of acute hyperactive withdrawal delirium occurring in a man with a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is F10.231 severe alcohol use disorder with alcohol withdrawal delirium, acute, hyperactive. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe alcohol use disorder is not given. Medication-induced delirium.\nThe name of the medication-induced delirium begins with the specific substance (e.g., dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the delirium. The name of the disorder is followed by the course (i.e., acute, persistent), followed by the specifier indicating level of psychomotor activity (i.e., hyperactive, hypoactive, mixed level of activity). For example, in the case of acute hyperactive medication-induced delirium occurring in a man using dexamethasone as prescribed, the diagnosis is F19.921 dexamethasone-induced delirium, acute, hyperactive.\nSpecifiers Regarding course, in hospital settings, delirium usually lasts about 1 week, but some symptoms often persist even after individuals are discharged from the hospital.\nIndividuals with delirium may rapidly switch between hyperactive and hypoactive states. The hyperactive state may be more common or more frequently recognized and often is associated with medication side effects and drug withdrawal.

Substance-induced major neurocognitive disorder: If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced major neurocognitive disorder, the 4th position character is \u201c1,\u201d and the clinician should record \u201cmild [substance] use disorder\u201d before the substance-induced major neurocognitive disorder (e.g., \u201cmild inhalant use disorder with inhalant-induced major neurocognitive disorder\u201d). For alcohol and sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic substances, a mild substance use disorder is insufficient to cause a substance-induced major neurocognitive disorder; thus, there are no available ICD-10-CM codes for this combination. If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced major neurocognitive disorder, the 4th position character is \u201c2,\u201d and the clinician should record \u201cmoderate [substance] use disorder\u201d or \u201csevere [substance] use disorder,\u201d depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder, then the 4th position character is \u201c9,\u201d and the clinician should record only the substance-induced major neurocognitive disorder.\nSubstance-induced mild neurocognitive disorder: If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced mild neurocognitive disorder, the 4th position character is \u201c1,\u201d and the clinician should record \u201cmild [substance] use disorder\u201d before the substance-induced mild neurocognitive disorder (e.g., \u201cmild\ncocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced mild neurocognitive disorder\u201d).

The ICD-10-CM code that corresponds to the applicable drug class is selected from the table included in the criteria set. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., intrathecal methotrexate), the ICD-10-CM code for the other (or unknown) substance class should be used and the name of the specific substance recorded (e.g., F19.988 intrathecal methotrexate-induced\nmild neurocognitive disorder). In cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific substance is unknown, the ICD-10-CM code for the other (or unknown) substance class is used, and the fact that the substance is unknown is recorded (e.g., F19.97 unknown substance-induced major neurocognitive disorder).\nWhen recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word \u201cwith,\u201d followed by the name of the disorder (i.e., [specific substance]\u2013induced major neurocognitive disorder or [specific substance]\u2013induced mild neurocognitive disorder), followed by the type in the case of alcohol (i.e., nonamnestic- confabulatory type, amnestic-confabulatory type), followed by specification of duration (i.e., persistent). For example, in the case of persistent amnestic-confabulatory symptoms in a man with a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is F10.26 severe alcohol use disorder with alcohol-induced major neurocognitive disorder, amnestic-confabulatory type, persistent. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe alcohol use disorder is not given. If the substance- induced neurocognitive disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a sporadic heavy use of inhalants), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F18.988 [specific inhalant]\u2013induced mild neurocognitive disorder)."}, "Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to HIV Infection": {"code": null, "criteria": "A.

A personality disorder is an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the norms and expectations of the individual\u2019s culture, is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time, and leads to distress or impairment.\nWith any ongoing review process, especially one of this complexity, different viewpoints emerge, and an effort was made to accommodate them. Thus, personality disorders are included in both Sections II and III. The material in Section II represents an update of text associated with the same criteria found in DSM-5 (which were carried over from DSM-IV-TR), whereas Section III includes the proposed model for personality disorder diagnosis and conceptualization developed by the DSM-5 Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group. As this field evolves, it is hoped that both versions will serve clinical practice and research initiatives, respectively.\nThe following personality disorders are included in this chapter.\nParanoid personality disorder is a pattern of distrust and suspiciousness such that others\u2019 motives are interpreted as\nmalevolent.\nSchizoid personality disorder is a pattern of detachment from social relationships and a restricted range of emotional\nexpression.\nSchizotypal personality disorder is a pattern of acute discomfort in close relationships, cognitive or perceptual distortions,\nand eccentricities of behavior.\nAntisocial personality disorder is a pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others, criminality, impulsivity,\nand a failure to learn from experience.\nBorderline personality disorder is a pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and\nmarked impulsivity.\nHistrionic personality disorder is a pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking.\nNarcissistic personality disorder is a pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy.\nAvoidant personality disorder is a pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative\nevaluation.\nDependent personality disorder is a pattern of submissive and clinging behavior related to an excessive need to be taken\ncare of.\nObsessive-compulsive personality disorder is a pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and control.\nPersonality change due to another medical condition is a persistent personality disturbance that is judged to be the direct\npathophysiological consequence of another medical condition (e.g., frontal lobe lesion).\nOther specified personality disorder is a category provided for two situations: 1) the individual\u2019s personality pattern meets\nthe general criteria for a personality disorder, and traits of several different personality disorders are present, but the criteria\nfor any specific personality disorder are not met; or 2) the individual\u2019s personality pattern meets the general criteria for a\npersonality disorder, but the individual is considered to have a personality disorder that is not included in the DSM-5\nclassification (e.g., passive-aggressive personality disorder). Unspecified personality disorder is for presentations in which\nsymptoms characteristic of a personality disorder are present but there is insufficient information to make a more specific\ndiagnosis.\nThe personality disorders are grouped into three clusters based on descriptive similarities. Cluster A includes paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal personality disorders. Individuals with these disorders often appear odd or eccentric. Cluster B includes antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic personality disorders. Individuals with these disorders often appear dramatic, emotional, or erratic. Cluster C includes avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorders. Individuals with these disorders often appear anxious or fearful. It should be noted that this clustering system, although useful in some research and educational situations, has serious limitations and has not been consistently validated. For instance, two or more disorders from different clusters, or traits from several of them, can often co-occur and vary in intensity and pervasiveness.\nA review of epidemiological studies from several countries found a median prevalence of 3.6% for disorders in Cluster A, 4.5% for Cluster B, 2.8% for Cluster C, and 10.5% for any personality disorder. Prevalence appears to vary across countries and by ethnicity, raising questions about true cross-cultural variation and about the impact of diverse definitions and diagnostic instruments on prevalence assessments.\nDimensional Models for Personality Disorders The diagnostic approach used in this manual represents the categorical perspective that personality disorders are qualitatively distinct clinical syndromes. An alternative to the categorical approach is the dimensional perspective that personality disorders represent maladaptive variants of personality traits that merge imperceptibly into normality and into one another. See Section III for a full description of a dimensional model for personality disorders. The DSM-5 personality disorder clusters (i.e., odd-eccentric, dramatic-emotional, and anxious- fearful) may also be viewed as dimensions representing spectra of personality dysfunction on a continuum with other mental disorders. The alternative dimensional models have much in common and together appear to cover the important areas of personality dysfunction. Their integration, clinical utility, and relationship with the personality disorder diagnostic categories and various aspects of personality dysfunction continue to be under active investigation. This includes research on whether the dimensional model can clarify the cross-cultural prevalence variations seen with the categorical model.\nGeneral Personality Disorder\nCriteria\nA.
