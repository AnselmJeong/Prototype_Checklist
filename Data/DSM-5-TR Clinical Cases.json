[{"heading": "Neurodevelopmental Disorders", "diagnosis": ["Intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability), severe", "Autism spectrum disorder, with accompanying intellectual and language"], "text": " Ashley, age 17, was referred for a diagnostic reevaluation after having carried diagnoses\n\n of autism and intellectual disability for almost all of her life. She was recently found to\n\n have Kleefstra syndrome, and the family wanted to reconfirm the earlier diagnoses and\n\n assess the genetic risk to the future children of her older sisters.\n\n At the time of the reevaluation, Ashley was attending a special school with a focus on\n\n functional skills. She was able to dress herself, but she was not able to shower\n\n independently or be left alone in the house. She was able to decode (e.g., read words)\n\n and spell at a second-grade level but understood little of what she read. Changes to her\n\n schedule and heightened functional expectations tended to make her irritable. When\n\n upset, Ashley would often hurt herself (e.g., biting her wrist) and others (e.g., pinching\n\n and hair pulling).\n\n In formal testing done at the time of the reevaluation, Ashley had a nonverbal IQ of 39\n\n and a verbal IQ of 23, with a full scale IQ of 31. Her adaptive scores were somewhat\n\n higher, with an overall score of 42 (with 100 as average).\n\n By history, Ashley first received services at age 9 months after her parents noticed\n\n significant motor delays. She walked at 20 months and was toilet trained at 5 years. She\n\n\n-----\n\n##### spoke her first word at age 6. She received a diagnosis of developmental delay at age 3\n\n and of autism, obesity, and static encephalopathy at age 4. An early evaluation noted\n\n possible facial dysmorphology; genetic tests at that time were noncontributory.\n\n Her parents indicated that Ashley knew hundreds of single words and many simple\n\n phrases. She had long been very interested in license plates and would draw them for\n\n hours. Her strongest skill was memory, and she could draw precise representations of\n\n license plates from different states. Ashley had always been very attached to her parents\n\n and sisters, and although affectionate toward babies, she showed minimal interest in\n\n other teenagers.\n\n Ashley\u2019s family history was pertinent for a father with dyslexia, a paternal uncle with\n\n epilepsy, and a maternal male cousin with possible \u201cAsperger\u2019s syndrome.\u201d Her siblings,\n\n both sisters, were in college and doing well.\n\n On examination, Ashley was an overweight young woman who made inconsistent eye\n\n contact but often peered out the corner of her eye. She had a beautiful smile and would\n\n sometimes laugh to herself, but most of the time her facial expressions were subdued.\n\n She did not initiate joint attention by trying to catch another person\u2019s eyes. She\n\n frequently ignored what others would say to her. To request a preferred object (e.g., a\n\n shiny magazine), Ashley would rock from foot to foot and point. When offered an object\n\n (e.g., a small decorated box), she brought it to her nose and lips for inspection. Ashley\n\n spoke in a high-pitched voice with unusual intonation. During the interview, she used\n\n multiple words and a few short phrases that were somewhat rote but communicative,\n\n such as \u201cI want to clean up,\u201d and \u201cDo you have a van?\u201d\n\n In the months prior to the evaluation, Ashley\u2019s parents noticed that she had become\n\n increasingly apathetic. A medical evaluation concluded that urinary tract infections were\n\n the most likely cause for her symptoms, but antibiotics seemed only to make her more\n\n listless. Further medical evaluation led to more extensive genetic testing, and Ashley was\n\n diagnosed with Kleefstra syndrome, a rare genetic defect associated with multiple\n\n medical problems, including intellectual developmental disorder. The parents said they\n\n were also tested and found to \u201cbe negative.\u201d\n\n The parents specifically wanted to know whether the genetic testing results affected\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Ashley s long standing diagnoses and access to future services. Furthermore, they\n\n wanted to know whether their other two daughters should get tested for their risk of\n\n carrying genes for autism, intellectual disability, and/or Kleefstra syndrome.\n\n### "}, {"heading": "Neurodevelopmental Disorders", "diagnosis": ["Autism spectrum disorder requiring support for deficits in social communication"], "text": "##### The authors would like to thank Arshya Vahabzadeh, M.D., for his contributions to an\n\n earlier edition of this case.\n\n Robyn Thom, M.D.\n\n Eugene Beresin, M.D.\n\n Christopher McDougle, M.D.\n\n Brandon was a 12-year-old boy brought in by his mother for psychiatric evaluation for\n\n temper tantrums that seemed to be contributing to declining school performance. The\n\n mother became emotional as she reported that things had always been difficult but had\n\n become worse after Brandon entered middle school. Shortly after starting middle school,\n\n Brandon had started complaining of stomachaches on school-day mornings and was\n\n often reluctant to go to school.\n\n Brandon\u2019s sixth-grade teachers reported that he was academically capable but that he\n\n had little ability to make friends. He seemed to mistrust the intentions of classmates who\n\n tried to be nice to him but attempted to befriend others who laughingly feigned interest\n\n in the toy cars and trucks that he brought to school. The teachers noted that he often\n\n cried and rarely spoke in class. In recent months, multiple teachers had heard him\n\n screaming at other boys, generally in the hallway but sometimes in the middle of class.\n\n The teachers had not identified a cause but generally had not disciplined Brandon\n\n because they assumed he was responding to provocation. He was embarrassed about\n\n these outbursts and did not want to go to swim practice because he did not want his\n\n swim friends to ask why he\u2019d had an outburst at school.\n\n When interviewed alone, Brandon responded with nonspontaneous mumbles when\n\n asked questions about school, classmates, and his family. When the examiner asked if he\n\n was interested in toy cars, however, Brandon lit up. He pulled several cars, trucks, and\n\n airplanes from his backpack and, while not making good eye contact, did talk at length\n\n about vehicles, using their apparently accurate names (e.g., front-end loader, B-52,\n\n Jaguar). When asked again about school, Brandon pulled out his cell phone and showed\n\n a string of text messages: \u201cdumbo!!!!\u201d \u201cmr stutter\u201d; \u201cLoSeR\u201d; \u201cfreak!\u201d; \u201cEVERYBODY\n\n\n-----\n\n##### HATES YOU. While the examiner read the long string of texts that Brandon had saved\n\n but apparently not previously revealed, Brandon added that other boys would whisper\n\n \u201cbad words\u201d to him in class and then scream in his ears in the hall. \u201cAnd I hate loud\n\n noises.\u201d He also told the examiner that he sometimes wished that he had never been\n\n born.\n\n Developmentally, Brandon spoke his first word at age 11 months and began to use short\n\n sentences by age 3. He had always been very focused on trucks, cars, and trains.\n\n According to his mother, he had always been \u201cvery shy\u201d and had never had a best friend.\n\n As he has gotten older, it has become more apparent that he struggles with jokes and\n\n typical young adolescent banter because \u201che takes things so literally.\u201d Brandon\u2019s mother\n\n had long seen this behavior as \u201ca little odd\u201d but added that it was not much different\n\n from that of Brandon\u2019s father, a successful attorney, who had similarly focused interests.\n\n Both of them were \u201csticklers for routine\u201d who \u201clacked a sense of humor.\u201d Brandon\u2019s\n\n mother noted that he made efforts to conceal his interest in trucks, cars, and trains\n\n outside of the home but would eagerly speak about them when encouraged. Brandon has\n\n shared with his mother that he tries to appear \u201cnormal\u201d when interacting with peers at\n\n school, which is exhausting. He often feels nervous around peers and generally tries to\n\n avoid socializing.\n\n On examination, Brandon was shy and generally nonspontaneous. He made below\n average eye contact. His speech was coherent and goal directed. At times, Brandon\n\n stumbled over his words, paused excessively, and sometimes rapidly repeated words or\n\n parts of words. Brandon said he felt okay but added that he was scared of school,\n\n particularly when around other children. He appeared sad, brightening only when\n\n discussing his toy cars. He denied current suicidal thoughts or plans as well as\n\n homicidality. He denied psychotic symptoms. He was cognitively intact.\n\n### "}, {"heading": "Neurodevelopmental Disorders", "diagnosis": ["Major depressive disorder, mild, single episode", "History of panic disorder; rule out current", "History of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, with predominantly inattentive", "Specific learning disorder affecting the domains of reading (both fluency and"], "text": " Carlos was a 19-year-old Hispanic college student in his freshman year at a public\n\n university in a large city. He was referred by his guidance counselor to the hospital\u2019s\n\n outpatient psychiatric clinic for help with academic difficulties. Since starting college 6\n\n months earlier, he had done poorly on tests and been unable to manage his study\n\n schedule. His worries that he was going to flunk out of college were leading to anxiety,\n\n insomnia, poor concentration, and a general sense of hopelessness. After a particularly\n\n tough week, he told his family that he thought he should quit. His mother accompanied\n\n him to the clinic that had previously helped both Carlos and his younger brother. The\n\n mother specifically wondered whether Carlos\u2019s \u201cADHD\u201d might be causing his problems,\n\n or whether he had outgrown it.\n\n Carlos had been seen at the same clinic when he was age 9, at which time he had been\n\n diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), predominantly\n\n\n-----\n\n##### combined type. Notes from that clinical evaluation indicated that Carlos had been in\n\n trouble at school for not following instructions, not completing homework, getting out of\n\n his seat, losing things, not waiting his turn, and not listening. He had trouble\n\n concentrating except in regard to video games, which he \u201ccould play for hours.\u201d Carlos\n\n had apparently been slow to talk, but his birth and developmental histories were\n\n otherwise normal. He repeated first grade because of behavioral immaturity and\n\n difficulty learning to read. The ease with which Carlos learned English, his second\n\n language, was not noted. His family had emigrated to the United States from the\n\n Dominican Republic when he was 5 years old. The family was Catholic and attended\n\n church every Sunday. Both of his parents worked in maintenance and housekeeping at a\n\n local municipal hospital.\n\n During the evaluation when Carlos was age 9, a psychoeducational assessment by a\n\n clinical psychologist confirmed reading problems (particularly problems in reading\n\n fluency and comprehension). Carlos did not, however, meet the school board criteria for\n\n a learning disability, which required evidence of a 20-point discrepancy between IQ and\n\n achievement scores. Thus, he was not eligible for special education services. The\n\n evaluator had noted Carlos to be eager to do well and anxious about underperforming.\n\n His anxiety was thought to be a reaction to his school difficulties and his challenges in\n\n meeting the academic expectations of his family. Carlos\u2019s pediatrician had recommended\n\n pharmacotherapy, but his parents did not want to pursue medication. They cited\n\n negative experiences with local youth who used diverted controlled substances and hung\n\n out \u201con the street.\u201d Instead, his mother reported taking on an extra job to pay for tutors\n\n to help her son \u201cwith concentration and reading.\u201d The eldest of four siblings, Carlos had\n\n done well with this intervention and was now the first member of his family to attend\n\n college.\n\n The psychiatry trainee carefully reviewed Carlos\u2019s academic history; his symptoms,\n\n including the course and severity of sadness, anxiety, insomnia, and hopelessness; and\n\n his social and developmental history. She obtained collateral history from his family and\n\n school records. She used the revised DSM-5-TR Core Cultural Formulation Interview for\n\n assistance in obtaining a better understanding of Carlos\u2019s acculturation experiences, the\n\n family\u2019s past feelings about the clinic\u2019s recommendations, and what treatment\n\n interventions would be relevant and acceptable to Carlos and his family\n\n\n-----\n\n##### The psychiatry trainee learned that Carlos had a childhood history of nervousness\n\n identified by a neighborhood curandera (traditional healer) as ataque de nervios. The\n\n family had addressed this problem with supportive prayer and a traditional herbal tea.\n\n They had apparently not revealed this to the psychiatrist at the time, thinking he would\n\n find it irrelevant and not wishing to seem disrespectful of his authority. During these\n\n unrevealed episodes of acute anxiety, Carlos would experience trembling and agitation,\n\n palpitations, shortness of breath, dread of harm, and fear of separation from caregivers.\n\n Workup by the pediatrician had revealed no physiological cause.\n\n Since starting college, Carlos reported that he had frequently been unable to remain\n\n focused while reading and listening to lectures. He was easily sidetracked and therefore\n\n had difficulty handing in his written assignments on time. He complained of feeling\n\n restless, agitated, and worried. He described difficulty falling asleep, poor energy, and an\n\n inability to \u201chave fun\u201d like his peers. He reported that the depressive symptoms went \u201cup\n\n and down\u201d over the course of the week and possibly influenced his problems with\n\n concentration; it was hard for him to be certain. He denied substance use.\n\n Carlos said that he\u2019d had some great teachers in high school who had understood him,\n\n helped him get the meaning of what he read, and allowed him to audiotape lectures and\n\n use other formats (e.g., videos, wikis, visual presentations) for final assignments.\n\n Without this support at college, he said he felt \u201clonely, stupid, a failure\u2014unable to cope.\u201d\n\n Although advised by his high school teacher to do so, Carlos had not registered with the\n\n university\u2019s student disability services office. He preferred not to be seen as different\n\n from his peers and thought he should be able to get through college by himself.\n\n Carlos\u2019s family history was positive for ADHD in a younger brother. A cousin was\n\n reported to have had \u201cdyslexia\u201d and had dropped out of a local community college after\n\n one semester. His social and developmental history revealed that he had been well liked\n\n by his cluster of friends throughout school. His group consisted of boys and girls and\n\n tended to consist of kids more interested in school than in sports. Carlos denied ever\n\n having dated or been sexually active, and he also denied having any significant interest\n\n in pursuing either of these activities.\n\n On examination Carlos was well-groomed polite and soft-spoken He wore clean jeans\n\n\n-----\n\n##### a T shirt, and a hoodie that he kept pulling down over his face. He sat quietly and\n\n hunched over. He sighed a lot and rarely made eye contact with the clinician. He often\n\n tapped his fingers and shuffled in his seat but responded appropriately to questions. His\n\n command of English appeared strong, but he spoke with a slight Spanish accent. He\n\n often mumbled and mispronounced some multisyllabic words (e.g., he said\n\n \u201cliteralchure\u201d instead of \u201cliterature\u201d and \u201cintimate\u201d when he clearly meant \u201cintimidate\u201d).\n\n He denied any suicidal thoughts. He appeared motivated to do better. On a follow-up\n\n interview with the psychiatry trainee, Carlos asked whether the conversations were\n\n confidential. When informed that they were, he hesitantly admitted that he felt\n\n overwhelmed by new relationships with college peers. He indicated that \u201cin my\n\n neighborhood growing up, everybody was Dominican, but in college, I\u2019m the only\n\n Dominican.\u201d He also quietly said that he thought he might \u201clike guys rather than girls.\u201d\n\n He revealed two recent episodes of panic \u201clike when I was a kid\u201d that had occurred\n\n during social situations. He declined to go into further detail.\n\n After these two initial sessions, the psychiatrist suggested extending the evaluation so\n\n that they could optimize a treatment strategy. She told Carlos that she wanted to better\n\n understand his mood and anxiety symptoms, as well as how he felt about being the first\n\n in his family to go to college (i.e., role transitions), and to talk a little more about his\n\n concerns about his sexual orientation. She also referred Carlos for updated\n\n psychoeducational testing. This psychoeducational reassessment confirmed that Carlos\u2019s\n\n reading and writing abilities were substantially and quantifiably below those expected\n\n for his age. That report also concluded that these learning difficulties were not\n\n attributable to intellectual developmental disorder, uncorrected visual or auditory\n\n acuity, psychosocial adversity, or lack of proficiency in the language of academic\n\n instruction. The report concluded that Carlos had specific difficulties with reading\n\n fluency and comprehension as well as spelling and written expression.\n\n### "}, {"heading": "Neurodevelopmental Disorders", "diagnosis": ["Specific learning disorder (mathematics)", "Generalized anxiety disorder"], "text": " Daphne, a 13-year-old in the ninth grade, was brought for a psychiatric evaluation\n\n because of academic and behavioral struggles. She had particular difficulty starting and\n\n completing schoolwork and following instructions, and she had received failing grades in\n\n math. When prompted to complete tasks, Daphne became argumentative and irritable.\n\n She had become increasingly resistant to attending school, asking to stay home with her\n\n mother. These difficulties had been evident since early childhood but had worsened\n\n significantly this year. Because Daphne had become increasingly distressed, her parents\n\n have been less insistent on making her do any activity that upsets her.\n\n Psychological testing indicated that Daphne had above-average intelligence, age\n appropriate achievement in all subjects except math, and some difficulties in\n\n visuospatial skills. The test results were shared with the school, which offered additional\n\n tutoring. Daphne attended only a few sessions, stating that they were not helpful. Her\n\n parents talked to the school counselors and Daphne\u2019s teachers, asking for more services.\n\n They were told repeatedly that Daphne needed to be more assertive and ask for help.\n\n Several teachers commented that Daphne should be more motivated and try harder.\n\n Several years earlier her pediatrician had diagnosed ADHD and prescribed a stimulant\n\n\n-----\n\n##### She took the medication for a week, but her parents stopped giving it to her because she\n\n seemed agitated.\n\n At home, Daphne\u2019s parents\u2019 close supervision of her homework often led to arguments\n\n with crying and screaming. Her behavior and attitude were noticeably better when she\n\n was out of school. She had two long-standing friends but had made no new close friends\n\n for several years. In groups with other children, she preferred to play with those younger\n\n than she. When her friends chose the activity or did not follow her rules, she tended to\n\n withdraw. She was generally quiet in groups and in school but more interactive with\n\n family members and individuals she knew well.\n\n Since early childhood, Daphne has had difficulty falling asleep, requiring a nightlight\n\n and parental reassurance. Recognizing that Daphne was easily upset by change, her\n\n parents rarely forced her into new activities. She did well during the summer, which she\n\n spent with her grandparents. Her parents reported no particular traumas, stressors, or\n\n developmental or medical problems. Daphne had started her menses about 2 months\n\n prior to the evaluation. Her family history was pertinent for multiple first- and second\n degree relatives with mood, anxiety, or learning disorders.\n\n At first meeting, Daphne was shy and tense. Her eye contact was poor, and she had\n\n difficulty talking about anything other than her plastic horse collection. Within 15\n\n minutes, she became more comfortable, revealing that she disliked school because the\n\n work was too hard. She thought that other children did not seem to like her because she\n\n was stupid and was not into clothes and dating. Sometimes they made fun of her and\n\n would start laughing whenever the teacher called on her. There were several peers who\n\n had similar interests in animals and seemed okay. She has been eating lunch with them\n\n but found it hard to relax and to believe that they really wanted to be friends. Daphne\n\n was always afraid of making mistakes, getting bad grades, and disappointing everyone.\n\n Often, she was so preoccupied with what to say or do next that she did not pay attention\n\n to her peers or teachers. She frequently was unable to make a decision for fear of not\n\n being right. Daphne was unable to identify any personal strengths or any aspect of her\n\n life that was going well. She wished she had more friends and that she was smarter. As\n\n long as she could remember, she had always felt this way. These difficulties made her\n\n sad, but she denied persistent depressive feelings or suicidal thoughts. She appeared\n\n\n-----\n\n##### anxious but brightened when discussing her horse figurine collection, her longtime\n\n friends, and her family.\n\n### "}, {"heading": "Neurodevelopmental Disorders", "diagnosis": ["Provisional tic disorder", "Separation anxiety disorder"], "text": " Ethan, a 9-year-old boy, was referred to a psychiatric clinic by his teacher, who noticed\n\n that his attention was flagging.

He tended to get fidgety and distracted when the academic work\n\n became more challenging, and the teacher suggested the parents seek neuropsychiatric\n\n testing for him.\n\n At home, Ethan\u2019s mother explained, he seemed more emotional of late: \u201cHe just looks\n\n weepy sometimes, which is unusual for him.\u201d She denied any difficulties at home, and\n\n she described her husband, son, 8-year-old daughter, and herself as a \u201chappy family.\u201d\n\n She had noticed, however, that Ethan seemed uneasy about being left alone. He had\n\n\n-----\n\n##### become clingy, often following his parents around the house, and he hated being in any\n\n room by himself.

Although Ethan had a few good\n\n friends in the neighborhood and at school and was glad to have other kids come to his\n\n house, he refused to go on sleepovers.\n\n Ethan\u2019s mother agreed that he appeared more fidgety. She had noticed that he often\n\n seemed to be shrugging his shoulders, grimacing, and blinking, which she took to be a\n\n sign of anxiety. These movements worsened when he was tired or frustrated, and they\n\n diminished in frequency during calm, focused activities such as clarinet practice or\n\n homework, especially when she was helping him.\n\n His mother also mentioned that Ethan had suddenly become \u201csuperstitious.\u201d Whenever\n\n he stepped through a doorway, he would go back and forth until he touched both\n\n doorjambs with his hands simultaneously, twice in rapid succession.

He\n\n was somewhat fidgety, tugging at his pants and shifting in his seat. Hearing his mother\n\n talk about his new movements seemed to provoke them, and the examiner noted that\n\n Ethan also occasionally blinked tightly, rolled his eyes, and made throat-clearing noises.\n\n Ethan said that he sometimes worried about \u201cbad things\u201d happening to his parents.

A more complete story was elicited from a\n\n friend of Ms. Allen\u2019s who had been on the bus but who had not been arrested. According\n\n to her, they had boarded the bus on their way to a nearby shopping mall. Ms. Allen\n\n became frustrated when the driver refused her dollar bills, instead demanding exact\n\n change. She looked in her purse, but instead of finding exact change, she pulled out a\n\n kitchen knife that she carried for protection. The driver fled, so she got into the empty\n\n seat and drove the bus across the street into a nearby parked car.\n\n On examination, Ms. Allen was a handcuffed, heavyset young woman with a bandage on\n\n her forehead. She fidgeted and rocked back and forth in her chair. She appeared to be\n\n mumbling to herself. When asked what she was saying, the patient made momentary eye\n\n contact and just repeated, \u201cSorry, sorry.\u201d She did not respond to other questions.\n\n More information was elicited from a psychiatrist who had come to the ER soon after the\n\n accident. He said that Ms. Allen and her friend were longtime residents at the state\n\n psychiatric hospital where he worked. They had just begun to take passes every week as\n\n part of an effort toward social remediation; it had been Ms. Allen\u2019s first bus ride without\n\n a staff member.\n\n According to the psychiatrist, Ms. Allen had received a diagnosis of \u201cchildhood-onset,\n\n treatment-resistant paranoid schizophrenia.\u201d She had started hearing voices by age 5\n\n years. Big, strong, intrusive, and psychotic, she had been hospitalized almost constantly\n\n since age 11. Her auditory hallucinations generally consisted of a critical voice\n\n commenting on her behavior. Her thinking was concrete, but when relaxed she could be\n\n self-reflective. She was motivated to please and recurrently said her biggest goal was to\n\n \u201chave my own room in my own house with my own friends.\u201d The psychiatrist said that he\n\n was not sure what had caused her to pull out the knife. She had not been hallucinating\n\n lately and had been feeling less paranoid, but he wondered if she had been more\n\n psychotic than she had let on. It was possible that she was just impatient and irritated.\n\n The psychiatrist also believed that she had spent almost no period of life developing\n\n normally and so had very little experience with the real world.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Ms. Allen had been taking clozapine for 1 year, with good resolution of her auditory\n\n hallucinations. She had gained 35 pounds on the clozapine, but she had less trouble\n\n getting out of bed in the morning and was functioning at a higher level. She was hoping\n\n to get a job and live more independently, and the bus trip had been intended as a step in\n\n that direction.

He had joined an evangelical church 4 months earlier in the\n\n context of being \u201criddled with guilt\u201d about \u201call the things I\u2019ve done.\u201d Three months\n\n earlier, he began \u201chearing voices trying to make me feel guilty\u201d most days. The last\n\n auditory hallucination had been the day before. During these past few months, he\n\n became withdrawn and noticed that strangers were commenting on his past sins.\n\n Mr. Coleman believed that his migraines and guilt might be due to alcohol withdrawal.\n\n He had been drinking three or four cans of beer most days of the week for several years\n\n until he \u201cquit\u201d 4 months earlier after joining the church. He still drank \u201ca beer or two\u201d\n\n every other week but felt guilty afterward. He denied alcohol withdrawal symptoms such\n\n as tremor and sweats. He had smoked cannabis up to twice monthly for years but\n\n completely quit when he joined the church. He denied using other illicit drugs except for\n\n one uneventful use of cocaine 3 years earlier. He sometimes would sleep only a few hours\n\n and did report some nightmares. Otherwise, Mr. Coleman denied depressive, manic, or\n\n psychotic symptoms and violent ideation.\n\n Regarding PTSD, Mr. Coleman\u2019s score on the 20-item self-administered PTSD Checklist\n\n for DSM-5 was below the cutoff score (between 31 and 33 out of 80) that would indicate\n\n probable PTSD in veterans.

Regarding other stressors, he felt\n\n overwhelmed by his current responsibilities, which included attending school and near\n\n-----\n\n##### daily church activities. He had been a straight A student at the start of the school year\n\n but was now receiving Bs and Cs.\n\n The patient\u2019s girlfriend and sister were interviewed separately. They agreed that Mr.\n\n Coleman had become socially isolative and quiet, after having previously been fun and\n\n outgoing. He had also never been especially religious prior to this episode. His sister\n\n believed that Mr. Coleman had been \u201cbrainwashed\u201d by the church. His girlfriend,\n\n however, had attended services with Mr. Coleman. She reported that several members of\n\n the congregation had told her they had occasionally talked to new members who felt\n\n guilt over their prior behaviors, but none who had ever hallucinated, and they were\n\n worried about him.\n\n A physical examination of the patient, including a neurological screen, was\n\n unremarkable, as were routine laboratory testing, a blood alcohol level, and urine\n\n toxicology.

At about the same time, Mr.\n\n Evans began to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana every day. In addition, he developed\n\n recurrent panic attacks, marked by a sudden onset of palpitations, diaphoresis, and\n\n thoughts that he was going to die. When he was at his most depressed and panicky, he\n\n twice received a combination of sertraline 100 mg/day and psychotherapy. In both cases,\n\n his most intense depressive symptoms lifted within a few weeks, and he discontinued the\n\n sertraline after a few months. Between episodes of severe depression, he was generally\n\n seen as sad, irritable, and amotivated. His school performance declined around tenth\n\n grade and remained marginal throughout the rest of high school. He did not attend\n\n college as his parents had expected him to, but instead lived at home and did odd jobs in\n\n the neighborhood.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Around age 20, Mr. Evans developed a psychotic episode in which he had the conviction\n\n that he had murdered people when he was 6 years old. Although he could not remember\n\n who these people were or the circumstances, he was absolutely convinced that this had\n\n happened, something that was confirmed by continuous voices accusing him of being a\n\n murderer. He also became convinced that other people would punish him for what had\n\n happened, and thus he feared for his life. Over the ensuing few weeks, he became guilt\n ridden and preoccupied with the idea that he should kill himself by slashing his wrists,\n\n which culminated in his being psychiatrically hospitalized.\n\n Although he was predominantly anxious on admission, Mr. Evans soon became very\n\n depressed, with prominent anhedonia, poor sleep, and decreased appetite and\n\n concentration. With the combined use of antipsychotic and antidepressant medications,\n\n both the depression and the psychotic symptoms remitted after 4 weeks. Therefore, the\n\n total duration of the psychotic episode was approximately 7 weeks, 4 of which were also\n\n characterized by major depressive disorder. Mr. Evans had been hospitalized with the\n\n same pattern of symptoms two additional times before age 22, and each of these\n\n episodes started with several weeks of delusions and hallucinations related to his\n\n conviction that he had murdered someone when he was a child, followed by severe\n\n depression lasting an additional month. Both relapses occurred while he was apparently\n\n adherent to reasonable dosages of antipsychotic and antidepressant medications. During\n\n the 3 years prior to this evaluation, Mr. Evans had been adherent to clozapine and had\n\n been without hallucinations and delusions. He had also been adherent to his\n\n antidepressant medication and supportive psychotherapy, although his dysphoria,\n\n irritability, and amotivation never completely resolved.\n\n Mr. Evans\u2019s history was significant for marijuana and alcohol misuse that began at age\n\n 15. Before the onset of psychosis at age 20, he smoked several joints of marijuana almost\n\n daily and binge-drank on weekends, with occasional blackouts. After the onset of the\n\n psychosis, he decreased his marijuana and alcohol use significantly, with two several\n month-long periods of abstinence, yet he continued to have psychotic episodes up\n\n through age 22. He started attending Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous\n\n groups, achieved sobriety from marijuana and alcohol at age 23, and had remained sober\n\n for the 2 years prior to this evaluation.\n\n\n-----\n\n### "}, {"heading": "Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders", "diagnosis": ["Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder", "Bipolar I disorder, in remission", "Cannabis use disorder, moderate"], "text": " Kevin Foster, a 32-year-old married white man with a history of bipolar disorder, was\n\n brought to the emergency room (ER) by police after his wife called 911 to report that he\n\n was threatening to jump out of their hotel window.\n\n At the time of the episode, Mr. Foster and his wife were on vacation, celebrating their\n\n fifth anniversary. To commemorate the event, they decided to get tattoos. Afterward,\n\n they went to a nearby park, where Mr. Foster bought and smoked a marijuana cigarette.\n\n During the ensuing hour, Mr. Foster began to believe that the symbols in his tattoo had\n\n mysterious meaning and power. He became convinced that the tattoo artist was\n\n conspiring with others against him and that his wife was cheating on him. After\n\n returning to the hotel, the patient searched his wife\u2019s phone for evidence of her infidelity\n\n and threatened to jump out the window.

She had become preoccupied with ways in which\n\n she might kill herself without inconveniencing others. Her dominant suicidal thoughts\n\n involved shooting herself in the head while leaning out the window, so as not to cause a\n\n mess in the dorm. Although she did not have access to a gun, she spent time searching\n\n the Web for places where she might purchase one.\n\n Ms. Jacobs\u2019s psychiatric history began at age 15, when she began to regularly drink\n\n alcohol and smoke marijuana, usually when out at dance clubs with friends. Both of\n\n\n-----\n\n##### these substances calmed her, and she denied that either had become problematic. She\n\n had used neither alcohol nor marijuana since starting graduate school.\n\n Around age 17, she began experiencing brief, intense depressive episodes, marked by\n\n tearfulness, feelings of guilt, anhedonia, hopelessness, low energy, and poor\n\n concentration. She would sleep more than 12 hours a day and neglect responsibilities at\n\n school and home.\n\n These depressive episodes would generally shift after a few weeks into periods of\n\n increased energy, pressured speech, and unusual creativity. She would stay up most of\n\n the night working on projects and building architectural models. These revved-up\n\n episodes lasted about 5 days and were punctuated by feelings that her friends had turned\n\n against her and that they were not really friends at all. Worried especially about the\n\n paranoia, her family had brought her to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed her as having\n\n bipolar II disorder and prescribed lithium and sertraline. Although Ms. Jacobs\u2019s moods\n\n did not completely stabilize on this regimen, she did well enough at a local university to\n\n be accepted into a prestigious graduate program far from home. At that point the\n\n depression returned, and she became intensely suicidal for the first time.\n\n Upon evaluation, the patient was visibly depressed and tearful, and had psychomotor\n\n slowing. She said it was very difficult to get out of bed and she was not attending class\n\n most days. She reported hopelessness, poor concentration, and guilt about spending\n\n family money for school when she was not able to perform.

She said she was\n\n preoccupied with concerns that her new boss and colleagues thought her work was\n\n inadequate and slow and that she was unfriendly. She had no energy and enthusiasm at\n\n home, either, and instead of playing with her children or talking to her husband, she\n\n tended to watch television for hours, overeat, and sleep excessively. This had led to a 6\n pound weight gain in just 3 weeks, which made her feel even worse about herself. She\n\n had begun to cry several times a week, which she reported as the sign that she \u201cknew the\n\n depression had returned.\u201d She had also begun to think often of death, although she had\n\n never attempted suicide.\n\n Ms. Kershaw said her memory about her history of depressions was a little fuzzy, so she\n\n brought in her husband, who had known her since college. They agreed that she had first\n\n become depressed in her teens and that she had experienced at least five discrete periods\n\n of depression as an adult. These episodes generally included depressed mood, anergia,\n\n amotivation, hypersomnia, hyperphagia, deep feelings of guilt, decreased libido, and\n\n mild to moderate suicidal ideation without plan. Her depressions were often punctuated\n\n\n-----\n\n##### by periods of too much energy, irritability, pressured speech, and flight of ideas. These\n\n episodes of excess energy could last hours, days, or a couple of weeks. The depressed\n\n mood would not lift during these periods, but she would \u201cat least be able to do a few\n\n things.\u201d\n\n When specifically asked, Ms. Kershaw\u2019s husband described distinctive times when Ms.\n\n Kershaw seemed unusually excited, happy, and self-confident, and like a \u201cdifferent\n\n person.\u201d She would talk fast, seem energized and optimistic, do the daily chores very\n\n efficiently, and start (and often finish) new projects. She would need little sleep and still\n\n be enthusiastic the next day. Ms. Kershaw recalled these periods but said they felt\n\n \u201cnormal.\u201d In response to a question about hypersexuality, Ms. Kershaw smiled for the\n\n only time during the interview, saying that although her husband seemed to be including\n\n her good periods as part of her illness, he had not been complaining when she had her\n\n longest such episode (about 6 days) when they first started dating in college. Since then,\n\n she reported that these episodes were \u201cfairly frequent\u201d and lasted 2 or 3 days.\n\n Because of her periodic low mood and thoughts of death, she had seen various\n\n psychiatrists since her mid-teenage years. Psychotherapy tended to work \u201cokay\u201d until\n\n she had another depressive episode, when she would be unable to attend sessions and\n\n would then just quit. Three antidepressant trials of adequate dosage and duration\n\n (6 months to 3 years) were each associated with short-term relief of depression, followed\n\n by relapse. Both alone and in the presence of her husband, Ms. Kershaw denied any\n\n history of alcohol or substance misuse. A maternal aunt and maternal grandfather had\n\n been recurrently hospitalized for mania, although Ms. Kershaw was quick to point out\n\n that she was \u201cnot at all like them.\u201d\n\n On examination, Ms. Kershaw was a well-groomed, overweight woman who often\n\n averted her eyes and tended to speak very softly. No abnormal motor movements were\n\n noted, but her movements were constrained, and she did not use hand gestures. Her\n\n mood was depressed. Her affect was sad and constricted.

By contrast, sometimes she\n\n would have \u201cbursts\u201d of nonstop thinking about her estranged boyfriend and devising\n\n ways to \u201cget him back,\u201d alternating with \u201cgrieving his loss.\u201d She described times of being\n\n\n-----\n\n##### flooded with strategies to regain his interest (including purchasing a full page newspaper\n\n \u201copen letter\u201d to him) and recently found herself awake until 5:00 or 6:00 a.m. journaling\n\n or calling friends in the middle of the night \u201cfor support.\u201d She would then \u201ctrudge\n\n through the day\u201d without fatigue after only 2\u20133 hours of sleep. These symptoms began\n\n prior to her hospitalization. She denied drug or alcohol misuse and self-injurious\n\n behavior. Until this particular breakup, she denied a history of particularly intense or\n\n chaotic relationships, as well as a history of suicidal thoughts or gestures. Indeed, Ms.\n\n Bates seemed horrified by her own impulsive overdose.\n\n Previously, Ms. Bates had seen a counselor in high school for \u201cmoodiness\u201d and poor\n\n grades. She became \u201cdepressed\u201d in college. At that time, she began escitalopram and\n\n psychotherapy, but improved quickly and stopped both after a few weeks. While in the\n\n hospital following her suicide attempt, she started taking vilazodone and quetiapine at\n\n bedtime \u201cfor sleep.\u201d\n\n Ms. Bates was the youngest of three children who grew up in a middle-class suburban\n\n home. She attended public school and a state college as \u201cmostly a B student\u201d and hoped\n\n to someday go to law school. She described herself as having been a \u201cquiet, anxious\u201d\n\n child and \u201cnot a troublemaker.\u201d Her older brother abused multiple substances, although\n\n Ms. Bates said she herself had never used illicit substances. Her older sister was treated\n\n for \u201cpanic attacks and depression,\u201d and Ms. Bates knew of several aunts and cousins\n\n whom she thought were \u201cdepressed.\u201d\n\n On examination, Ms. Bates was a pleasant, well-related, casually but appropriately\n\n dressed, moderately overweight woman, appearing her stated age, who made good eye\n\n contact. Her speech was somewhat rapid and verbose but interruptible and\n\n nonpressured. She had no abnormal motor movements, but she gestured dramatically\n\n and with excessive animation. Her mood was depressed, and her affect was tense and\n\n dysphoric but with full range and normal responsivity. Ms. Bates\u2019s thought processes\n\n were somewhat circumstantial but generally coherent, linear, and logical. Her thought\n\n content was notable for passive thoughts that she might be better off dead, but without\n\n intent or plan; she had no delusions, hallucinations, or homicidal thoughts. Her higher\n\n integrative functioning was grossly intact, as were her insight and judgment.\n\n\n-----\n\n### "}, {"heading": "Depressive Disorders", "diagnosis": ["Other specified depressive disorder (depressive episode with insufficient"], "text": " Ian Campbell was a 32-year-old architect who presented for psychiatric consultation\n\n because he was floundering at work. His boss had expressed concern after he failed to\n\n make progress on a simple project. When Mr. Campbell explained that he had been\n\n distracted by problems at home, his boss suggested that more seemed wrong. Mr.\n\n Campbell called his internist, who sent him to a neurologist, who referred him for\n\n psychiatric evaluation.\n\n Mr. Campbell had encountered this problem, difficulty concentrating, before. In college,\n\n after his father died of a chronic illness, Mr. Campbell had been unable to study and had\n\n taken time off. Twice at his prior job, he experienced episodes lasting months in which\n\n he had difficulty making decisions. One of these intervals followed a romantic setback.\n\n The patient\u2019s mother and sister had been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and\n\n treated successfully with medication. A maternal uncle had committed suicide.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### The current impairment s onset accompanied the breakdown of Mr. Campbell s marriage\n\n of 6 years. Two months earlier, his wife had filed for divorce, announcing that she would\n\n live in the distant city her work had taken her to. Mr. Campbell had expected to feel\n\n relief; he said his wife had been hostile throughout the marriage. He had begun to\n\n entertain fond thoughts of a coworker. Nevertheless, he felt \u201cflat\u201d\u2014unable to imagine a\n\n future.\n\n Closer questioning revealed that Mr. Campbell\u2019s problems went beyond impaired\n\n cognition. He described apathy and diminished energy. Jazz was a passion, but he no\n\n longer attended recitals\u2014although impaired concentration probably played a role as\n\n well. Listening, the psychiatrist noted probable retardation of speech. Mr. Campbell said\n\n that his employer had mentioned that he was \u201cmoving in slow motion.\u201d The problems\n\n were worse in the mornings. In the evenings, Mr. Campbell noticed a spark of energy. He\n\n put on music and reviewed reports that he had ignored during the workday.\n\n Mr. Campbell declined to characterize himself as sad. He was pleased that the marriage\n\n was ending. But the psychiatrist was struck by her own affect in Mr. Campbell\u2019s\n\n presence; she felt glum, pessimistic, even weepy.\n\n She questioned Mr. Campbell at length about depressed mood, changed sleep and\n\n appetite, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, and thoughts of death. None of these\n\n attributions, he said, applied. Nor had he had indicators of disorders that can be\n\n confused with depression. Between episodes of impairment, he felt and functioned well.\n\n The psychiatrist decided that the problem at hand was close enough to depression to\n\n warrant treatment. Factors that influenced her decision included the partial syndromal\n\n presentation, diurnal variation, periodic recurrence, lack of future orientation, and her\n\n own empathic experience. She proposed psychotherapy centered on Mr. Campbell\u2019s\n\n decompensation in the face of loss. He insisted that he did not see the impending divorce\n\n in that light. The two agreed on brief psychotherapy supplemented by antidepressants.\n\n Within weeks, Mr. Campbell was functioning at full capacity. During the treatment, the\n\n psychiatrist was unable to elicit evidence of depressive symptoms beyond those noted in\n\n the initial history. All the same, she was convinced that the impaired concentration was a\n\n sign and symptom of something very much like major depressive disorder.\n\n\n-----\n\n### "}, {"heading": "Depressive Disorders", "diagnosis": ["Other specified depressive disorder (depressive episode with insufficient"], "text": " 44..1122 IInnssoommnniiaa aanndd PPhhyyssiiccaall CCoommppllaaiinnttss\n\n##### Russell F.

Over the preceding 11 months, the internist had prescribed\n\n clonazepam for sleep and Vicodin (hydrocodone/acetaminophen) for pain. Her sleep\n\n had improved and her pain decreased, but she continued to feel tired all day. At that\n\n point, the internist referred her for the psychiatric evaluation.\n\n Ms. Fang had immigrated to the United States from Thailand a decade earlier.

Afterward, he became scared that he might have a hidden disease. His parents\n\n reported three \u201cpanic attacks\u201d in the prior month, marked by anxiety, dizziness, sweats,\n\n and shortness of breath. About that same time, Logan began to complain of frequent\n\n headaches and stomachaches. Logan\u2019s own theory was that his bodily aches were caused\n\n\n-----\n\n##### by his fears about being ill and about his parents going away, but the pain was still\n\n uncomfortable.

These illness fears developed several times a\n\n week, usually when Logan was in bed, when he \u201cfelt something\u201d in his body, or when he\n\n heard about diseases.\n\n Logan had begun to suffer from anxieties as a young child. Kindergarten was notable for\n\n intense separation difficulties. He was briefly bullied in third grade, which led to his first\n\n panic attacks and worsening anxiety. According to his parents, \u201cthere always seemed to\n\n be a new anxiety.\u201d These included fear of the toilet, the dark, sleeping alone, being alone,\n\n and being pestered.\n\n Logan\u2019s most persistent fear revolved around his parents\u2019 safety. He was generally fine\n\n when both were at work or at home, but when they were in transit, or anywhere else, he\n\n was generally afraid that they would die in an accident. When the parents were late from\n\n work or when they tried to go out together or on an errand without him, Logan became\n\n frantic, calling and texting incessantly. Logan was predominantly concerned about his\n\n mother\u2019s safety, and she had gradually reduced her solo activities to a minimum. As she\n\n said, it felt like \u201che would like to follow me into the toilet.\u201d Logan was less demanding\n\n toward his father, who believed his wife had been too soft and overprotective.\n\n Logan and his family underwent several months of psychotherapy when Logan was age\n\n 10. The father said therapy helped his wife become less overprotective, and Logan\u2019s\n\n anxiety seemed to improve. Logan\u2019s mother agreed with this assessment, although she\n\n said she was not sure what she was supposed to do when her son was panicking\n\n whenever she tried to leave the house or whenever he worried about getting a disease.\n\n Logan\u2019s developmental history was otherwise unremarkable. His grades were generally\n\n good. His teachers agreed that he was quiet but had several friends and collaborated well\n\n with other children. He was quick, however, to negatively interpret the intentions of\n\n other children. For example, he tended to be very sensitive to any indication that he was\n\n being picked on.\n\n Logan\u2019s family history was pertinent for panic disorder, agoraphobia, and social anxiety\n\n disorder in the mother The maternal grandmother was described as \u201cat least as\u201d anxious\n\n\n-----\n\n##### as Logan s mother.

He had been struggling with depressive symptoms for years and had tried\n\n fluoxetine, citalopram, and supportive psychotherapy, with minor improvement. He\n\n worked full-time but engaged in very few activities outside of work.\n\n When asked how he felt, Mr. King said that his mood was low, he was unable to enjoy\n\n things, and he had insomnia, feelings of hopelessness, low energy, and difficulty\n\n concentrating and making decisions. He denied current suicidality but added that a few\n\n years earlier, he had taken a full bottle of medication with the intent to kill himself.

Aware of an unusually strong disinfectant smell, the interviewer asked the\n\n patient if he had any particular cleaning behaviors related to the HIV concerns. Mr. King\n\n paused and clarified that he avoided touching practically anything outside of his home.\n\n When further encouraged, Mr. King said that if he even came close to things that he\n\n considered potentially contaminated, he had to wash his hands incessantly with\n\n household bleach. He described that he felt like \u201csomething was still there\u201d in his hands\n\n and he had to wash his hands until it felt that he had finally done it \u201cright.\u201d\n\n On average, Mr. King washed his hands up to 30 times a day, spending hours on this\n\n routine. Physical contact was particularly difficult. Shopping for groceries and taking\n\n public transportation were a big problem, and he had almost given up trying to socialize\n\n or engage in romantic relationships. These behaviors had only intensified during the\n\n COVID-19 pandemic, though a co-worker liked to joke that Mr. King had been cleaning\n\n and social distancing for years before it became fashionable.\n\n When asked if he had other worries, Mr. King replied that he had intrusive images of\n\n hitting someone, fears that he would say things that might be offensive or inaccurate,\n\n and concerns about disturbing his neighbors. To counteract the anxiety produced by\n\n these images and thoughts, he constantly replayed prior conversations in his mind, kept\n\n diaries to record what he said, and often apologized for fear he might have sounded\n\n offensive. When he showered, he made sure that the water in the tub only reached a\n\n certain level for fear that if he were not attentive, he would flood his neighbors.\n\n Mr. King used gloves at work and performed well.

During the prior 6 months, his symptoms had markedly worsened. He had\n\n become preoccupied with being infected by COVID-19 and spent the day cleaning not\n\n only his body but all of his clothing and linen. He had begun to insist that the family also\n\n wash their clothing and linen regularly, and that they keep the windows shut all the time.\n\n He allowed no visitors to their home. When the parents were occasionally exposed to\n\n other people by going outside, he insisted that they wear their masks in his presence for\n\n the ensuing 48 hours. The resulting conflicts had led to the current consultation.\n\n Mr. Lewis had in the past received a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and cognitive\n behavioral therapy for his symptoms. These had had some positive effects, and he had\n\n been able to complete high school successfully. Nevertheless, his symptoms had\n\n prevented him from completing college or working outside the home; he had long felt\n\n that his home was relatively germ-free in comparison to the outside world.

She felt that it all started when her mother got rid of her old toys when\n\n she was age 12. Now, many years later, Ms. Nichols\u2019s apartment had become filled with\n\n books, stationery, crafts, plastic packages, cardboard boxes, and all sorts of other things.\n\n She said she knew it was a little crazy, but these items could be handy one day.

Rooms in Ms. Nichols\u2019s apartment had begun to fill when she was in her\n\n early 30s, and by the time of the interview, she had little room to live. Her kitchen was\n\n almost entirely full, so she used a mini fridge and a toaster oven that she had wedged\n\n into piles of paper in the hallway. She ate her meals in the only available chair.

She was pessimistic\n\n that anything would work, but she and her mother agreed that she should seek help.\n\n Ms. Oliver\u2019s hair pulling most often took place as a ritual when she returned home from\n\n her job as a paralegal. She would search for hairs of a particular texture from the crown\n\n of her head (though she also pulled from her eyebrows, eyelashes, and pubic region). She\n\n felt intense relief if the hair came out with its root. She would then typically bite off the\n\n root of the hair and swallow the rest of the hair.

She said the hair pulling had begun at\n\n age 12, and she had never known anyone with similar behaviors.\n\n Ms. Oliver fought hard to stop the behavior and, at times, had been able to stop for\n\n several months at a time.

When\n\n unexpectedly startled by sudden noises, he tended to fly into a rage. That was apparently\n\n one reason he had chosen to be a self-employed electrician: he could work by himself.\n\n Similarly, he enjoyed hunting and gardening, activities that he could enjoy in quiet\n\n solitude.\n\n Reluctantly, he described intrusive memories of watching his fellow soldiers die in the\n\n field, which caused him enormous shame, guilt, and sadness, Several times a week, he\n\n awakes in a panicky sweat after a combat nightmare, although, as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s\n\n ridiculous. Those guys have been dead for 50 years.\u201d\n\n Although these symptoms are very distressing, Mr. Reynolds is most worried about his\n\n \u201chair-trigger\u201d temper. Without cause, he finds himself antagonizing other drivers who\n\n cut him off, confronting strangers who stand too close to him in checkout lines, and\n\n shifting into \u201cattack mode\u201d when approached from behind by others. He springs into this\n\n aggressive mode automatically, without a thought or consideration of the circumstances.\n\n Although he keeps a handgun in the console of his car for self-protection, Mr. Reynolds\n\n has no intention of harming others. He is always remorseful after a threatening incident\n\n and worries that he might inadvertently hurt someone. Most recently, while drifting off\n\n\n-----\n\n##### to sleep on his physician s examination table, a nurse touched his foot, and he leapt up\n\n and began cursing in a threatening manner. He felt as if he were back on guard duty,\n\n when he was accidentally dozing, and an incoming mortar round stunned him into\n\n action. His reaction scared both the nurse and himself.\n\n Mr. Reynolds\u2019s symptoms apparently began soon after he left Vietnam, where he served\n\n as a field radio operator.

He was angered\n\n by his girlfriend\u2019s decision to end the relationship, particularly her failure to understand\n\n his concerns about establishing financial stability. He increasingly ruminated about\n\n money, his grades, and his future.\n\n Mr. Sims was a full-time undergraduate employed as a full-time midnight-shift\n\n warehouse worker.

His grades had\n\n recently declined, however, and he had become increasingly discouraged about money\n\n and about being his family\u2019s first college student. His parents did not understand why he\n\n had decided to attend an out-of-state university, and he was increasingly dissatisfied\n\n with life on the predominantly white college campus after some recent experiences of\n\n racial discrimination.

At the time of the evaluation, he said he occasionally had a beer or\n\n marijuana cigarette at parties, but that he didn\u2019t have the time, money, or inclination to\n\n get intoxicated.\n\n On examination, Mr. Sims was punctual, cooperative, pleasant, attentive, appropriately\n\n dressed, and well groomed. He spoke coherently. He appeared generally worried and\n\n constricted, but he smiled appropriately several times during the interview. He said he\n\n felt bad about his declining grades, but he denied feeling guilty or worthless. He had a\n\n quiet, dry sense of humor. He denied current suicidality, homicidality, and psychosis.

Dr. Ulysse had shrugged off two\n\n referrals, but after being told that he was being released from work until he got clearance\n\n from psychiatry, he agreed to an evaluation.\n\n Dr. Ulysse stated that he was fine, \u201cjust a little burned out.\u201d He\u2019d always prided himself\n\n on having more energy than everyone else, but he\u2019d started getting worn down during\n\n the COVID-19 pandemic. He said he was sleeping poorly, was always tired, and was\n\n having trouble concentrating. After about 20 minutes, he asked if he could leave, that he\n\n felt better already. The psychiatrist explained that she would need to meet with him at\n\n least a few times before she could allow him to go back to work.\n\n Reminded that he wasn\u2019t yet ready to go back to work, Dr. Ulysse appeared to slump in\n\n his seat. When the psychiatrist asked him to say more, he replied that he hated being this\n\n way, hated being weak.\n\n He said he knew he had burnout. He\u2019d read up on it, and he felt exhausted, cynical about\n\n his being a \u201ccog in the medical-industrial complex,\u201d and less able to finish his daily work.\n\n He thought he might also have a depressive disorder, given that he was sad just about\n\n every day and also felt tired, worthless, and unable to sleep and concentrate normally.\n\n He said this had been going on for 12 or 18 months, but he\u2019d been \u201cgood at hiding things\n\n until recently.\u201d Dr. Ulysse asked whether the psychiatrist could diagnose him with\n\n burnout, since he\u2019d prefer not to get a label that is a \u201ccareer killer, at least for a surgeon.\u201d\n\n He said he would be completely adherent with an antidepressant medication if the\n\n psychiatrist would let him go back to work. When asked if he felt suicidal, he responded\n\n that he had always thought that was a ridiculous question: \u201cIf you\u2019re really serious about\n\n suicide, why tell somebody who has 911 on speed dial? But no, I\u2019m not going to kill\n\n myself.\u201d\n\n At this point, the psychiatrist asked for more background information. Dr. Ulysse was\n\n the only child born to a pharmacist and a French professor, who had left Haiti when he\n\n was born. He had grown up in a suburban area where he was often the only Black child\n\n in his grade.

I literally dated the homecoming\n\n queen, and nobody seemed to mind about the Black/white thing.\u201d At that point, he\n\n laughed and added, \u201cwell, except for my Gran, my dad\u2019s mother, who lived with us when\n\n I was growing up. She thought I was asking for trouble.\u201d\n\n After a few moments of silence, Dr. Ulysse began to quietly cry. When asked to say more,\n\n he explained that his parents worked \u201call the time\u201d when he was young, so his\n\n grandmother lived with them and took care of him throughout his school years. She had\n\n died of COVID-19 about 18 months earlier. Since then, he described thinking about her\n\n \u201call the time\u201d and having become increasingly preoccupied by his failure to convince her\n\n to get the COVID vaccine.\n\n He said he knew it was ridiculous, but he had partially believed her when she had\n\n insisted that she was able to protect everyone in the family from the virus. \u201cDid I\n\n mention my Gran was a Catholic witch, and a very good one?\u201d Dr. Ulysse added that\n\n although he knew she was dead, part of him continued to expect her to walk through the\n\n door, and he looked up multiple times every day, expecting her to be there. He spent\n\n long hours reviewing his inability to convince her to get the vaccine as well as his\n\n decision not to visit her for months for fear of infecting her. He awoke with nightmares\n\n most nights. He didn\u2019t remember the content of the dreams very well, but they tended to\n\n be about his grandmother disappearing and him being unable to help. He noted that he\n\n had become increasingly angry and bitter at colleagues, his parents, and his ex\n girlfriend. Since she had moved out of their apartment 6 months earlier, he hadn\u2019t\n\n spoken to her or seen any of his friends. His parents called frequently and have tried to\n\n \u201ckidnap\u201d him for a weekend with family, but they appear to have gotten frustrated that\n\n he was being so stubborn. He said that he was okay watching TV\u2014where he focused on\n\n \u201cpestilence and wars\u201d\u2014but he just felt too numb to talk to people. He also stated that he\n\n barely knew who he was anymore, and that his job as a surgery trainee had come to seem\n\n irrelevant if it meant that he couldn\u2019t even help his family. Although he was definitely\n\n not going to kill himself, and he knew the whole idea was \u201cstupid,\u201d he did daydream\n\n almost every day about being dead so that he could see his grandmother again\n\n\n-----\n\n### "}, {"heading": "Dissociative Disorders", "diagnosis": ["Dissociative amnesia", "Major depressive disorder, chronic, with suicidal ideation"], "text": "##### Judith Vaughan was a 29 year old special education teacher who sought a psychiatric\n\n consultation because \u201cI\u2019m tired of always being sad and alone.\u201d\n\n The patient reported chronic, severe depression that had not responded to multiple trials\n\n of antidepressants and mood stabilizer augmentation.

A note sent ahead revealed that she had been tearful\n\n and frustrated at her last medical appointment, and her doctor, who had been struggling\n\n to control the patient\u2019s persistent back pain, felt that an evaluation by a psychiatrist\n\n might be helpful.\n\n Greeting Ms. Adams in the waiting room, the psychiatrist was struck by both her\n\n appearance and her manner: here was a woman with shaggy silver hair and dark\n\n sunglasses, seated in a wheelchair, who offered a limp handshake and a plaintive sigh\n\n before asking the psychiatrist if he would mind pushing her wheelchair into his office.\n\n She was tired from a long commute, and, she explained, \u201cNobody on the street offered to\n\n help me out. Can you believe that?\u201d\n\n Once settled, Ms. Adams stated that she had been suffering from unbearable back pain\n\n for the previous 13 months. On the night \u201cthat changed everything,\u201d she had locked\n\n herself out of her apartment and, while trying to climb in through a fire escape, had\n\n fallen and fractured her pelvis, coccyx, right elbow, and three ribs. Although she did not\n\n require surgery, she was bed-bound for 6 weeks and then underwent several months of\n\n physical therapy. Daily opioid medication had been only moderately helpful. She had\n\n seen \u201ca dozen\u201d doctors of various specialties and tried multiple treatments, including\n\n anesthetic injections and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation therapy, but her\n\n pain was unrelenting. Throughout this ordeal and for years previously, Ms. Adams\n\n smoked cannabis daily, explaining that a joint enjoyed in hourly puffs \u201csoftened\u201d her\n\n pain and helped her to relax. She did not drink alcohol or use other illicit drugs.\n\n Prior to the accident, Ms. Adams had worked at a neighborhood salon for more than 20\n\n years. She was proud to have had a large number of devoted clients, and she relished the\n\n camaraderie with her colleagues, whom she referred to as \u201cmy real family.\u201d She had been\n\n unable to return to work since her accident on account of the pain. \u201cThese doctors keep\n\n telling me I\u2019m good to go back to work,\u201d she said with visible anger, \u201cbut they don\u2019t know\n\n what I\u2019m going through.\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cThey don\u2019t believe me. They think I\u2019m lying.\u201d\n\n She added that although friends had initially reached out after the accident, lately they\n\n had seemed less sympathetic.

As for\n\n her mood, she said, \u201cI\u2019m so depressed it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d She often felt hopeless of any\n\n possibility of living without pain but denied ever thinking of suicide. She explained that\n\n her Catholic faith prevented her from considering taking her own life.\n\n Ms. Adams had never seen a psychiatrist before and did not recall ever having felt\n\n depressed prior to her accident, although she described a \u201chot temper\u201d as a family trait.\n\n She spoke of only one meaningful romantic relationship, many years previously, with a\n\n woman who was emotionally abusive. When asked about any legal difficulties, she\n\n revealed several arrests for theft in her 20s.

Nocturnal leg spasms and daytime leg aches had\n\n been her initial concerns. She then developed sleep difficulties that led to \u201cbrain fog\u201d and\n\n head heaviness. She had intermittent cold sensations in her extremities, face, ears, eyes,\n\n and nasal passages. Pulsating sensations in her eyes were, she thought, more\n\n pronounced after a poor night\u2019s sleep. In recent months, she had developed difficulty\n\n urinating, menstrual irregularity, and multiple muscle complaints, including right\n\n gluteal pain with a burning sensation into her right thigh. She also had neck stiffness\n\n with accompanying thoracic back spasms.\n\n Ms. Balaban\u2019s primary care physician had evaluated the initial symptoms and then\n\n referred her to a rheumatologist and a neurologist. The rheumatologist diagnosed\n\n mechanical back pain without evidence of inflammatory arthritis. She had also\n\n diagnosed possible migraines with peripheral neuropathic and ocular symptoms. The\n\n neurologist noted that Ms. Balaban was also being evaluated by a neurologist and a\n\n neuro-ophthalmologist at a nearby medical center.

Psychiatric consultation had been recommended, but the\n\n patient declined until repeatedly urged by her primary care physician.\n\n Ms. Balaban initially spoke to the psychiatrist primarily about her physical complaints.\n\n She was very frustrated that despite having seen several specialists, she had received no\n\n clear diagnosis, and she was still very concerned about her symptoms. She had started\n\n taking fluoxetine and gabapentin, prescribed by her primary care physician, and\n\n experienced partial improvement in her mood and some of her pains. She found it\n\n difficult to concentrate and complete her work and was spending a lot of time on the\n\n internet researching her symptoms. For the past several months, she had kept a\n\n spreadsheet that tried to link her symptoms to her blood pressure and pulse.\n\n She also felt bad about not spending enough time with her children or husband, but just\n\n did not have the energy. She acknowledged bouts of depressed mood over the prior year\n\n with some anhedonia and occasional thoughts of suicide (she had considered crashing\n\n her car), but no anorexia or guilt. She described having experienced premenstrual\n\n depressive symptoms for about a year.\n\n Ms. Balaban had been treated for postpartum depression 6 years earlier after the birth of\n\n her second child.

He explained that he had\n\n been fatigued for a month and bedridden for a week. Then, saying he was too tired and\n\n confused to give much information, he asked the ER team to call his psychiatrist.\n\n The psychiatrist reported that he had treated Mr. Capek for more than two decades. He\n\n first saw Mr. Capek for a panic attack. It resolved with surprisingly small doses of\n\n clonazepam. After that, however, Mr. Capek continued to see him for help coping with\n\n his chronic illness. Initially a graduate student pursuing a master\u2019s degree in accounting,\n\n Mr. Capek dropped out of school over worries that the demands of his studies would\n\n exacerbate his disease. Since that time, his wife, a registered nurse, had been his primary\n\n support. He supplemented their income with small accounting jobs but limited these lest\n\n the stress affect his health.\n\n Mr. Capek usually felt physically and emotionally well. He deemed his occasional fatigue,\n\n anxiety, and concentration difficulties \u201ccontrollable\u201d and did not require treatment. Mr.\n\n Capek was typically averse to psychotropic medications and took a homeopathic\n\n approach to his disease, including exercise and proper nutrition. When his panic\n\n\n-----\n\n##### symptoms would reemerge, he used small doses (e.g., one quarter of a 0.5 mg lorazepam\n\n pill). His psychiatric sessions were commonly concerned about his underlying disease;\n\n he often brought articles on chronic Lyme disease for discussion and was active in a local\n\n Lyme disease support group.\n\n Mr. Capek\u2019s symptoms would occasionally worsen. However, these worsenings occurred\n\n less than yearly, and these \u201cexacerbations\u201d usually related to some apparent stress. The\n\n worst episode had been 1 year earlier, when his wife briefly left him following his\n\n revelation of an affair. Mr. Capek expressed shame about his behavior toward his wife\u2014\n\n both the affair and his inability to support her. He subsequently cut off contact with the\n\n other woman and attempted to expand his accounting work. The psychiatrist speculated\n\n that similar stress was behind his current symptoms.\n\n The psychiatrist communicated regularly with Mr. Capek\u2019s internist. His Lyme disease\n\n tests had thus far been negative. When the internist reported this, Mr. Capek became\n\n defensive and produced literature on the inaccuracy of Lyme disease testing. Eventually,\n\n the internist and the psychiatrist agreed on a conservative treatment approach with a\n\n neutral stance regarding the disease\u2019s validity.\n\n On examination, Mr. Capek was a healthy, well-developed adult male. He was anxious\n\n and spoke quietly with his eyes closed. He frequently lost his train of thought, but with\n\n encouragement and patience, he could give a detailed history consistent with the\n\n psychiatrist\u2019s account. Physical examination findings were unremarkable, and a\n\n standard laboratory screen was normal except for a slightly low hemoglobin value. The\n\n medical team chose to defer further Lyme testing, given the patient\u2019s many past negative\n\n tests. However, on hearing about the low hemoglobin, Mr. Capek became alarmed,\n\n dismissed reassurances, and insisted that the team investigate this further.\n\n### "}, {"heading": "Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders", "diagnosis": ["Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder) with attacks or"], "text": " Paulina Delcampo, a 32-year-old single woman with epilepsy that was first diagnosed\n\n during adolescence, was admitted to an academic medical center after her family found\n\n her convulsing in her bedroom. Before she was taken to the emergency room (ER),\n\n emergency medical services administered several doses of lorazepam, with no change in\n\n her condition. On arrival at the ER, a loading dose of fosphenytoin was administered to\n\n her; it stopped the convulsive activity. Blood tests obtained in the ER revealed\n\n therapeutic levels of her usual antiepileptics and no evidence of any infection or\n\n metabolic disturbance. Urine toxicology screens were negative for the use of illicit\n\n substances. Ms. Delcampo was admitted to the neurology service for further monitoring.\n\n During her admission, a routine electroencephalogram (EEG) was ordered. Shortly after\n\n the study began, Ms. Delcampo began convulsing; this prompted administration of\n\n intravenous (IV) lorazepam.

The consultation was called\n\n after the nurses became concerned that she was sad and lonely and was having a difficult\n\n time adjusting to her medical condition.\n\n Ms. Ehrlich was interviewed by the medical student on the psychiatry service. The\n\n patient indicated that the pain was excruciating and that she was neither sad nor lonely\n\n but was simply visiting from out of town, so no one knew she was even in the hospital.\n\n She told the medical student that her only previous therapy had been in college, when\n\n she went to student health services to get help for anxiety about test taking and her\n\n career choice. She had successfully completed a short course of cognitive-behavioral\n\n therapy, and the anxiety had not reappeared. She denied any other psychiatric history\n\n and had never taken psychiatric medication. In college, she studied psychology and\n\n worked part-time as a hospital orderly.

She had lost a job the year before because of absenteeism and had missed\n\n several job interviews due to her Crohn\u2019s flares.

Use of a recommended over-the-counter laxative was not helpful, and\n\n Thomas began to complain of nighttime pain. The discomfort led to a diminished\n\n interest in his favorite hobbies, which were video games and sports. Instead, he tended\n\n to stay in his room, playing with army men figurines that he had inherited from his\n\n grandfather\u2019s collection.

Ms.2\n\n Gaspard also reported having missed two menstrual periods in the past 6 months.\n\n Unable to find a medical explanation for Ms. Gaspard\u2019s symptoms and concerned about\n\n her extremely low weight, the physician referred Ms. Gaspard to the hospital eating\n\n disorders program.\n\n On presentation for psychiatric evaluation, Ms. Gaspard was cooperative and pleasant.\n\n She expressed concern about her low weight and denied fear of weight gain or body\n\n image disturbance: \u201cI know I need to gain weight. I\u2019m too skinny,\u201d she said. Ms. Gaspard\n\n reported that she had weighed 98 pounds prior to moving to the United States 1 year\n\n earlier and said she felt \u201cembarrassed\u201d when her family members and even strangers\n\n told her she had grown too thin. Notably, everyone else in her U.S.-dwelling extended\n\n family was either of normal weight or overweight.\n\n Despite her stated motivation to be at a healthy weight, Ms. Gaspard\u2019s dietary recall\n\n revealed that she was consuming only 600 calories per day. The day before the\n\n evaluation, for example, she had eaten only a small bowl of macaroni pasta, a plate of\n\n steamed broccoli, and a cup of black beans. Her fluid intake was also quite limited,\n\n typically consisting of only two or three glasses of water daily.\n\n Ms. Gaspard provided multiple reasons for her poor intake. The first was lack of\n\n appetite: \u201cMy brain doesn\u2019t even signal that I\u2019m hungry,\u201d she said. \u201cI have no desire to\n\n eat throughout the whole day.\u201d The second was postprandial bloating and nausea: \u201cI just\n\n feel so uncomfortable after eating.\u201d The third was the limited choice of foods permitted\n\n by her religion, which advocates a vegetarian diet. \u201cMy body is not really my own. It is a\n\n temple of God,\u201d she explained. The fourth reason was that her preferred sources of\n\n vegetarian protein (e.g., tofu, processed meat substitutes) were not affordable within her\n\n limited household budget.

When his sleep difficulties began, he\n\n woke with nothing particular on his mind. As the trouble persisted, he found himself\n\n dreading the upcoming day and wondering how he would teach his classes or focus on\n\n his writing if he was getting only a few hours of sleep. Some mornings he lay awake in\n\n the dark next to his fianc\u00e9e, who was sleeping soundly. On other mornings he would cut\n\n his losses, rise from bed, and go very early to his office on campus.\n\n After a month of interrupted sleep, Mr. Johns visited a physician\u2019s assistant at the\n\n university\u2019s student health services, where he customarily got his medical care.

The physician\u2019s assistant\n\n prescribed a sedative-hypnotic, which did not help. \u201cFalling asleep was never the\n\n problem,\u201d Mr. Johns explained. Meanwhile, he heeded some of the advice he read\n\n online. Although he felt reliant on coffee during the day, he never drank it after 2:00\n\n p.m. An avid tennis player, he restricted his court time to the early morning.

They were both successful\n\n attorneys in their late 30s. They had known each other since high school, had been\n\n dating for about 2 years, and planned to get married in about 6 months. Both denied\n\n ever having previously seen a therapist or received a psychiatric diagnosis.\n\n The couples therapist met with them together for one session. Both Ms. Olsen and Mr.\n\n Nelson reported being very much in love and wanting the marriage to work out, but they\n\n also said that they were fighting much of the time. Ms. Olsen said she admired Mr.\n\n Nelson\u2019s intelligence and steadiness and did not know why they fought. He, on the other\n\n hand, said he was still \u201ctotally infatuated\u201d but upset about Ms. Olsen\u2019s overall lack of\n\n interest in him. As the session neared a close, Mr. Nelson asked Ms. Olsen whether she\n\n wanted to bring up \u201cthe schedule, the alcohol, or the sex thing,\u201d at which she smiled and\n\n said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid we\u2019re out of time for today.\u201d\n\n The therapist met with each of them separately. At his meeting, Mr. Nelson said his\n\n biggest concern with Ms. Olsen was her lack of interest in sex. She seemed to go through\n\n the motions, he said, and always relied on alcohol. He worried that he was a \u201c7 trying to\n\n date a 10\u201d and that she just did not find him attractive. He was distressed about the fact\n\n that, try as he might, he was unable to bring her to orgasm or even to get her\n\n\n-----\n\n##### significantly aroused. This was, in turn, leading him to initiate sex less frequently, and\n\n even when he tried, he would \u201coften just give up half-way through.\u201d He had brought it up\n\n with her several times, but she had insisted that there was no problem. The therapist\n\n asked what he had meant by \u201cthe schedule thing.\u201d He explained that since they had\n\n begun dating, she had limited their time together to one \u201cschool night,\u201d usually a\n\n Tuesday, and then either a Friday or Saturday night. She had insisted that the schedule\n\n was necessary for her to complete her work and see her best girlfriends, but he had\n\n increasingly come to believe it was to avoid him.\n\n In her individual session, Ms. Olsen said she was most frustrated by Mr. Nelson\u2019s\n\n intensity and high desire for sex. She had set up their weekly schedule because otherwise\n\n he would want to constantly have sex with her. As it was, he wanted sex every time they\n\n got together, often twice in the same night. She readily admitted that she got drunk to\n\n tolerate intercourse. She added that she had used alcohol to numb herself since she\n\n began dating while in her teens. Until she had started dating Mr. Nelson, most of her\n\n sexual experiences had been \u201cwhile drunk with strangers.\u201d She had had a couple of\n\n boyfriends, but one was secretly gay and the other was \u201chappy to get a blow job every\n\n now and then.\u201d She had not told Mr. Nelson about these misadventures because she\n\n preferred that he continue to see her as \u201cthe near-virginal beauty queen.\u201d Although\n\n alcohol made intercourse acceptable, \u201csexual arousal was almost never tolerable\u201d and\n\n made her want to pass out. In recent months, Mr. Nelson had increasingly \u201cforced the\n\n orgasm issue.\u201d In the past, she would simply have broken up with any boyfriend who\n\n acted that way, but she believed she needed to stick it out because she was nearing 40\n\n and this would be her \u201clast chance to have a baby.\u201d When asked why she thought she had\n\n these issues with sex, Ms. Olsen looked out the window for almost a minute and then\n\n answered, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d\n\n### "}, {"heading": "Sexual Dysfunctions", "diagnosis": ["Medication-induced sexual dysfunction", "Major depressive disorder, in full remission"], "text": " Gerhard Palmer, a 55-year-old married accountant, presented to a psychiatrist for a\n\n second opinion in the context of recurrent major depressive disorder.

As long as she could remember, she had been teased and called a \u201csissy\u201d by\n\n neighborhood boys. She had generally preferred the company of girls throughout\n\n childhood. During her teen years, she continued to have many female friends but\n\n considered herself a gay male and dated a few other gay teens. She recalled trying her\n\n best to \u201cfit in\u201d but noted that she had always felt like an outsider.\n\n At age 19, during a romantic relationship with a man, she become aware of an intense\n\n desire to be a woman. That relationship ended, but Ms. Rohmer\u2019s desire to be a woman\n\n evolved into a strong sense that she had been born as the wrong gender. She tried to\n\n figure out whether this sense had existed earlier, but all she could recall was occasionally\n\n wishing she were a girl to fit in more comfortably with her friends.\n\n By age 20, Ms. Rohmer was very unhappy about being seen as a man. She viewed her\n\n genitalia as \u201crepugnant\u201d and a \u201cmistake of nature.\u201d Her family and some of her friends\n\n had not supported her developing sense of herself, and she recalled feeling increasingly\n\n hopeless, with episodic suicidal ideation and one nonlethal suicide attempt by overdose\n\n\n-----\n\n##### at age 21.\n\n Beginning at age 22, Ms. Rohmer lived as a female, including changing her name and\n\n exclusively wearing women\u2019s clothes.

She explored her sexuality during this time, dating both gay and\n\n straight men. Her anxiety diminished, although, as a member of a disenfranchised\n\n subgroup, she felt vulnerable to various types of aggression, including potential partner\n\n violence.\n\n The following year, at age 25, Ms. Rohmer had the gender on her driver\u2019s license and\n\n passport changed from male to female (a change of gender markers) and underwent\n\n gender-affirming surgeries that included vaginoplasty and breast augmentation. The\n\n results of these surgeries were satisfactory, and she was often happy with the transition.\n\n She described herself as being \u201cmore comfortable in her skin\u201d than she had ever been,\n\n and she only infrequently felt hopeless and suicidal.

He also felt dysphoric and \u201cachy\u201d when he abstained\n\n from taking the medication, and described a \u201ccraving\u201d for more opioids. He returned to\n\n the orthopedist, who referred him to a pain specialist.\n\n Mr. Winters was too embarrassed to go to the pain specialist, believing that his faith and\n\n strength should help him overcome the pain. He found it impossible to live without the\n\n pain medication, however, because of the pain, dysphoria, and muscle aches when he\n\n stopped the medication. He also began to \u201cenjoy the high\u201d and experienced intense\n\n craving. He began to frequent emergency rooms to receive more opioids, often lying\n\n about the timing and nature of his right knee pain, and even stole pills from his mother\n\n on two occasions. He became preoccupied with trying to find more opioids, and his work\n\n and home life suffered. He endorsed low mood, especially when contemplating the\n\n\n-----\n\n##### impact of opioids on his life, but denied any other mood or neurovegetative symptoms.\n\n Eventually, he told his primary care doctor about his opioid use and low mood, and that\n\n doctor referred him to the outpatient psychiatry clinic.\n\n Mr. Winters had a history of two lifetime major depressive episodes that were treated\n\n successfully with escitalopram by his primary care doctor. He also had a history of an\n\n alcohol use disorder when he was in his 20s. He managed to quit using alcohol on his\n\n own after a family intervention. He smoked two packs of cigarettes daily. His father\n\n suffered from depression, and \u201calmost everyone\u201d on his mother\u2019s side of the family had\n\n \u201cissues with addiction.\u201d He had been married to his wife for 20 years, and they had two\n\n school-age children.

Results of a\n\n recent physical examination and laboratory testing performed by his primary care\n\n physician had been within normal limits.\n\n On mental status examination, Mr. Winters was cooperative and did not exhibit any\n\n psychomotor abnormalities. He answered most questions briefly, often simply saying\n\n \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d Speech was of a normal rate and tone, without tangentiality or\n\n circumstantiality. He reported that his mood was \u201clousy,\u201d and his affect was dysphoric\n\n and constricted. He denied symptoms of paranoia or hallucinations.

At the time\n\n of the appointment, he had been without a permanent home for over 6 months. He had\n\n lived in various places, including his car and friends\u2019 homes. For over 1 month prior to\n\n presentation, he had been living in a tent in the woods. He had called his parents on his\n\n recent birthday, and they had offered to pay for substance use disorder treatment as long\n\n\n-----\n\n##### as they could pay directly.\n\n Mr. Xavier reported that his problem started at age 24, when he had a new wife and\n\n young child and had taken on two jobs to make ends meet (working in a factory and as a\n\n local delivery driver). When he injured his back and could not get to work because of the\n\n pain, a friend offered him a few tablets of acetaminophen-oxycodone (Percocet). Not\n\n only did his pain disappear, but his energy and mood improved. For the first time in his\n\n life, he felt \u201cnormal and happy.\u201d\n\n Mr. Xavier continued to use one to four Percocet tablets per day for 1\u00bd years. He never\n\n took more than one pill at a time. Then, at age 26, he snorted half a bag of heroin (about\n\n $5 on the street). \u201cIt took about 10 minutes, but I was transported into an indescribable\n\n euphoria. Like taking that first Percocet times 10. . . . You chase that first feeling for the\n\n rest of your life. It never repeats.\u201d Within months of starting heroin, he began using it\n\n intravenously in an effort to glimpse the euphoria again.\n\n After that first experience with heroin, the progression of use was rapid. Within\n\n 6 months, Mr. Xavier was unemployed, separated from his family, and homeless. \u201cI was\n\n sleeping in my car or on the streets . . . using up to 30 bags [$300] daily.\u201d\n\n Mr. Xavier began to reach out for help. He enrolled in outpatient rehabilitation for\n\n opioid users. The cravings to use, even while in treatment, were intense. Mr. Xavier\n\n reported multiple relapses. He added cocaine to the heroin injections, and \u201cspeedballs\u201d\n\n became Mr. Xavier\u2019s drug of choice for a while, but he then returned to using only\n\n heroin. The first of multiple accidental overdoses occurred in a vacant house when he\n\n was 27. He had been admitted to \u201cabout 10 detoxes and rehabs\u201d but would typically\n\n relapse within hours or weeks of discharge. He had also gone sporadically to Narcotics\n\n Anonymous meetings for years.\n\n To acquire money for his habit, he broke into homes, stole from relatives, and wrote bad\n\n checks. \u201cEvery penny went to drugs. I\u2019m lucky not to be in prison, but not so lucky in\n\n that everybody hates me.\u201d\n\n He decided to move to Martha\u2019s Vineyard a year prior to the consultation because it\n\n \u201csounded like a quiet place.\u201d He brought some methadone with him, but the eventual\n\n\n-----\n\n##### withdrawal was fierce.\n\n He continued to use heroin and oxycodone when he could easily get them. Otherwise, he\n\n drank alcohol heavily, although he said, \u201cI need to stop drinking\u2014that\u2019s what really gets\n\n me in trouble.\u201d He also took diazepam (Valium) sporadically; however, he did not\n\n consider that to be a problem but more of a way to get through the day.\n\n He worked occasionally as a landscaper. His boss\u2014someone he had met at a Narcotics\n\n Anonymous meeting\u2014had made it clear that he would call when there was extra work to\n\n be done, but that until Mr. Xavier got clean, the boss would not actually expect him to\n\n show up. He had held a variety of other odd jobs, including office supplies salesman,\n\n veterinary assistant, and gas station attendant. He had not seen his daughter in over 2\n\n years.\n\n On examination, Mr. Xavier appeared somewhat unkempt. He was generally cooperative\n\n but appeared restless, and at one point he urgently left the room; when he returned, he\n\n reported that he was experiencing bouts of diarrhea. His pupils were enlarged and his\n\n skin was remarkable for sweating and piloerection. He yawned several times and\n\n appeared irritable and unhappy. His arms and legs frequently twitched. He repeatedly\n\n blew his nose and appeared tearful. His speech was rapid, and he appeared impatient.\n\n He denied psychotic symptoms, suicidality, and homicidality. He said he was hopeful\n\n that if he could get some Suboxone (buprenorphine and naloxone), he might be able to\n\n keep a job and maybe get to be a real father.\n\n Laboratory studies were negative for HIV and hepatitis A, B, and C.\n\n### "}, {"heading": "Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders", "diagnosis": ["Adjustment disorder with anxiety", "Alcohol use disorder, mild", "Cannabis use disorder, mild"], "text": " Shaun Yates, a 32-year-old married African American information technology (IT)\n\n security analyst presented for treatment with a private psychiatrist because he felt\n\n\n-----\n\n##### stressed. He and his wife have two young children, and he reports a stable social life\n\n that includes a large extended family. This was his first psychiatric evaluation. He\n\n reported no past psychiatric history.\n\n Mr. Yates traced his increased stress to a death in his city 4 months earlier. The death\n\n was recorded on video and featured an unarmed Black man being murdered by two\n\n white off-duty policemen who had accused him of theft. Like many people, Mr. Yates\n\n first saw the video via his social media \u201ctimeline,\u201d where it was routinely reposted by his\n\n friends. Because the murder had occurred in his hometown, it received much local\n\n attention.\n\n Mr. Yates\u2019s social media timeline began to fill up with other examples of police brutality\n\n toward Black men. He said he watched the videos because they were \u201ctrending\u201d and\n\n appeared on his social media timeline abruptly, unfiltered, and without warning. In\n\n addition, he became increasingly aware of news programming, social media posts, and\n\n community memorials relating to the deaths and abuse of other Black men. Although he\n\n described trying to avoid details about these tragedies, he said that news, images, and\n\n videos were unavoidable, and he had become increasingly preoccupied with fears for the\n\n safety of his wife, his young sons, his extended family, and himself.\n\n Mr. Yates reported that under normal circumstances, he \u201cdidn\u2019t like to talk about this\n\n stuff,\u201d but his wife had insisted that he get treatment because she was concerned that he\n\n \u201cdidn\u2019t seem himself.\u201d Mr. Yates wanted the evaluating psychiatrist to understand that\n\n he was not paranoid or overly sensitive about racism, and that up until recently, he\u2019d\n\n been good about \u201ccompartmentalizing.\u201d Nevertheless, he admitted that it had become\n\n difficult to stop thinking about violence against unarmed Black men. He had recently\n\n disabled his social media accounts in a proactive effort to minimize his exposure to\n\n images and commentary regarding the incidents. In addition to stopping use of social\n\n media, he reported avoidance of newspapers, the internet, and television.\n\n Mr. Yates noted that he had also become edgy, nervous, and always on guard against\n\n attack.

He also had begun to drink a\n\n six-pack, or more, of beer after dinner, often \u201cpassing out\u201d in the family den. The alcohol\n\n helped him to relax, and smoking \u201ca blunt\u201d of marijuana before bedtime improved his\n\n sleep and reduced nightmares. He stated that the biggest problem with the cannabis was\n\n his wife\u2019s complaining that their young children might see him using it or that his use\n\n might be detected in a random urine toxicology screen at work. Mr. Yates had been\n\n increasingly late to work but had not mentioned to his wife that he had twice been\n\n reprimanded by his supervisor for the lateness.\n\n Mr. Yates reported first using both cannabis and alcohol at fraternity parties when he\n\n was about 19 years old. Throughout college, he smoked small amounts of marijuana once\n\n or twice weekly and rarely drank more than two beers at a time. In the decade since his\n\n college graduation, he had smoked marijuana only occasionally and tended to have no\n\n more than 1 or 2 beers on the weekend. He had never smoked tobacco or used other\n\n substances. His use of alcohol and cannabis had not increased until 3 months prior to\n\n the evaluation, after he started seeing the videos.\n\n Mr. Yates denied experiencing feelings of worthlessness, guilt, or hopelessness. He\n\n reported no prior history of panic attacks, mania, psychosis, or obsessive-compulsive\n\n symptoms, and he had never received psychiatric hospitalization or outpatient\n\n treatment.

He quit playing cards with neighbors because the rules had become\n\n confusing. He looked depressed and acted apathetic but generally said he was fine. His\n\n judgment and problem-solving skills appeared to have significantly declined. Despite\n\n having completed 4 years of college and worked for many years as a successful\n\n professional plumber, Mr. Estel was now periodically unable to operate household\n\n appliances.\n\n All of these cognitive problems seemed to fluctuate, so that his wife reported that\n\n sometimes he was \u201calmost like his old self,\u201d whereas at other times it was \u201clike living\n\n with a zombie, a depressed zombie.\u201d She also described his frequent exhaustion, daytime\n\n drowsiness and staring spells\n\n\n-----\n\n##### When asked specifically about her husband s sleep, Mrs. Estel reported that in fact\n\n neither of them slept well. Mainly, she said, it was because of her husband \u201cacting out his\n\n dreams.\u201d During these episodes, which occurred several times a month, he would punch\n\n and scream, and would occasionally fall out of bed. After sustaining bruises as a result of\n\n several of the episodes, Mrs. Estel decided it would be safer to sleep on the couch. She\n\n recalled that these sleep episodes began just before her husband retired; she had\n\n wondered at the time whether he had posttraumatic stress disorder, but she did not\n\n think he had suffered any particular trauma. A few years earlier, a friend had offered her\n\n a \u201csleeping pill\u201d that had helped her own husband with dementia. Mr. Estel had\n\n responded to the unknown medication with extreme rigidity and confusion, and his wife\n\n had nearly taken him to the emergency room in the middle of the night.\n\n Mrs. Estel denied that her husband had ever had any psychiatric illness. When asked\n\n about psychotic symptoms, she said that perhaps every week or so, he swatted at\n\n invisible things in the air. She did not think he heard voices or felt suspicious.\n\n Mr. Estel\u2019s medical history was notable for hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular disease\n\n with a history of stent placement, and possible transient ischemic attacks. His family\n\n history was positive for his mother having developed dementia in her mid-70s.\n\n On examination, Mr. Estel was a stooped, stiff man who shuffled into the office. While\n\n listening to his wife present the history, he stared into space, seeming to pay no attention\n\n to the content of the conversation. His right hand was tremulous. He appeared\n\n depressed, but when asked, he said he felt fine. His voice was so quiet that words were\n\n often unintelligible even when the interviewer leaned close. He drooled at times and did\n\n not notice until his wife wiped his chin.\n\n When asked to participate in cognitive testing, he shrugged his shoulders and said, \u201cI\n\n don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n### "}, {"heading": "Neurocognitive Disorders", "diagnosis": ["Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder"], "text": " 1177..66 PPaarraannooiiaa aanndd HHaalllluucciinnaattiioonnss\n\n##### Lorin M.

She had worked as a waitress for 20\n\n years but quit 10 years prior to the evaluation because of too many \u201cdropped trays,\u201d\n\n misremembered customer orders, and uncharacteristic irritability.

Ms. Franklin described her mood as \u201cnot well at all,\u201d and her\n\n affect was blunted and minimally reactive. Her speech was soft and slowed, with\n\n minimal spontaneity.

She\n\n asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s enough strivers for one family?\u201d\n\n Emily agreed to have her parents join the session, and they told a different story. They\n\n tearfully disclosed that their daughter had become irritable, unproductive, and\n\n oppositional. She drank to intoxication almost every night, often not returning home for\n\n an entire weekend. In searching her room, they had found small amounts of marijuana,\n\n alprazolam (Xanax), cocaine, and prescription stimulants. The parents described the\n\n changes in Emily\u2019s personality as \u201can adolescent nightmare\u201d and described her friends as\n\n \u201closers who do nothing but dye their hair, get tattoos, and hate everything.\u201d Emily\u2019s\n\n attitudes and behavior contrasted markedly with those of her parents and siblings. \u201cWe\n\n don\u2019t mind that she is doing her own thing and that she isn\u2019t conservative like the rest of\n\n us,\u201d her father said, \u201cbut it\u2019s like we don\u2019t even recognize who she\u2019s become.\u201d\n\n According to her parents, Emily\u2019s \u201cadolescent nightmare\u201d began 4 years earlier.

Instead of her former bright-eyed curiosity, Emily manifested a lack of\n\n interest in all her academic subjects, and her grades dropped from As to Ds. The parents\n\n were at an absolute loss to explain the sudden and dramatic change.\n\n The abrupt change in performance led the psychiatrist to ask Emily to take a battery of\n\n neuropsychological tests so the results could be compared with those of tests that she\n\n\n-----\n\n##### had taken when she had applied to a private high school several years earlier. In\n\n particular, Emily retook two high school admissions tests: the System for Assessment\n\n and Group Evaluation (SAGE), which measures a broad array of academic and\n\n perceptual aptitudes, and the Differential Aptitude Tests (DAT), which focus on\n\n reasoning, spelling, and perceptual skills.\n\n On the SAGE, her average percentile scores dropped from the upper 10% for a 13-year\n old to the bottom 10% for an adult (and the bottom 20% for a 13-year-old). When Emily\n\n took the DAT at age 13, she scored in the highest range for ninth graders across almost\n\n all measures. Her worst result had been in spelling, where she scored at the second\n highest level. Upon repeating the test at age 19, she scored below the high school average\n\n in all measures.\n\n EEG, brain CT, and T2-weighted brain MRI scans showed no evidence of structural\n\n brain damage. However, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) T2-weighted MRI\n\n displayed a clear lesion in the left frontal cortex, highly suggestive of previous injury to\n\n that region.\n\n Upon further questioning about the crucial period in which she seemed to have changed,\n\n Emily admitted to being in a traffic accident with her now ex-boyfriend, Mark. Although\n\n Emily did not recall much from this episode, she remembered that she hit her head and\n\n that she had bad headaches for many weeks thereafter. Because Emily was not bleeding\n\n and there was no damage to the car, neither Mark nor Emily reported the incident to\n\n anyone.

He had lost his last job 3 years earlier, had broken up with a\n\n girlfriend slightly later, and doubted that he would ever work or date again. He was\n\n embarrassed that he still lived with his mother, who was in her 80s. He denied any\n\n immediate intention or plan to kill himself, but stated that if he did not improve by the\n\n time his mother died, he did not see what he would have to live for. He denied\n\n disturbances in sleep, appetite, or concentration.\n\n Clinic records indicated that Mr. Goranov had been adherent to adequate trials of\n\n fluoxetine, escitalopram, sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and bupropion, as well as\n\n augmentation with quetiapine, aripiprazole, lithium, and levothyroxine. He had\n\n experienced some improvement in his mood while taking escitalopram but did not have\n\n remission of symptoms. He also received a course of cognitive-behavioral therapy early\n\n in his treatment, but he had been dismissive of the therapist and treatment, did not do\n\n his assigned homework, and appeared to make no effort to use the therapy between\n\n sessions.\n\n Mr. Goranov expressed frustration at his lack of improvement, the nature of his\n\n treatment, and his specific therapy. He found it \u201chumiliating\u201d that he was forced to see\n\n trainees who rotated off his case every year or two. He frequently found that the\n\n\n-----\n\n##### psychiatry residents were not especially educated, cultured, or sophisticated, and\n\n thought that they knew less about psychotherapy than he did.

This tendency held true in regard to both women who had tried\n\n to befriend him and therapists who had taken an interest in his care. Mr. Goranov\n\n described himself as someone who had a lot of love to give, but added that the world was\n\n full of manipulators. He said he had a few buddies, but his mother was the only one he\n\n truly cared about.

He exercised daily and was concerned about maintaining his\n\n body. Most of his time was spent at home watching television or reading novels and\n\n biographies.\n\n On examination, the patient was neatly groomed, had slicked-back hair, and wore\n\n designer hip-hop-inspired clothing generally favored by men in their 20s. He was\n\n coherent, goal directed, and generally cooperative. He said he was sad and angry. His\n\n affect was constricted and dismissive.

The two of them\n\n self-identified as queer, a label they found less stigmatizing than \u201clesbian.\u201d One evening,\n\n after an evening of drinking with her brother, Raven told him that she and Lilly enjoyed\n\n going to bondage parties, where they would role-play \u201cmistress-slave scenes\u201d in which\n\n they would wear tight leather clothing and high heels, and Lilly would whip Raven and\n\n call her derogatory or humiliating names. Raven was fine with being seen as a masochist\n\n in public, but in private, she generally enjoyed being in charge.\n\n Raven asked the psychiatrist whether he was \u201cthe kind of shrink who pathologizes\n\n everything? Surely, you\u2019re not like my brother, who gets squeamish about anything\n\n related to kink. But that\u2019s his problem, right doctor?

This interest had surfaced\n\n several years earlier and had not been a problem until he was caught masturbating by his\n\n wife 6 weeks prior to the evaluation. Upon seeing him dressed in panties and a bra, she\n\n initially \u201cwent nuts,\u201d thinking he was having an affair. After he clarified that he was not\n\n seeing anyone else, she \u201cshut him out\u201d and hardly spoke to him. When they argued, she\n\n called him a \u201cpervert\u201d and made it clear that she was considering divorce unless he \u201cgot\n\n\n-----\n\n##### help.\n\n Mr. Najarian\u2019s habit began in the setting of his wife\u2019s severe arthritis and likely\n\n depression, both of which significantly reduced her overall activity level and specifically\n\n her interest in sex. His \u201cfetish\u201d was the bright spot during his frequent and otherwise\n\n dreary business trips. He also masturbated at home but generally waited until his wife\n\n was out of the house. His specific pattern was to masturbate about twice weekly, using\n\n bras and panties that he had collected over several years. He said that intercourse with\n\n his wife had faded to \u201cevery month or two\u201d but was mutually satisfying.\n\n The patient had been married for over 30 years, and the couple had two grown children.\n\n Mr. Najarian had planned to retire comfortably later that year, but not if the two choices\n\n were either \u201cto be poor after we split the assets or to sit around the house all day and be\n\n called a pervert.\u201d\n\n He became visibly anxious when discussing his marital difficulties. He described some\n\n recent difficulty falling asleep and \u201cworried constantly\u201d about his marriage but denied\n\n other psychiatric problems. He had made a show of throwing away a half dozen pieces of\n\n underwear, which had seemed to reassure his wife, but he had saved his \u201cfavorites\u201d and\n\n \u201ccould always buy more.\u201d He said he was of mixed mind. He did not want to end his\n\n marriage, but he saw nothing harmful in his new mode of masturbating. \u201cI\u2019m not\n\n unfaithful or doing anything bad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just excites me, and my wife certainly\n\n doesn\u2019t want to be having sex a few times a week.\u201d\n\n Mr. Najarian denied any difficulties related to sexual functioning, adding that he could\n\n maintain erections and achieve orgasm without women\u2019s undergarments. He recalled\n\n being aroused when he touched women\u2019s underwear as a teenager and had masturbated\n\n repeatedly to that experience. That fantasy had disappeared when he became sexually\n\n active with his wife. He denied any personal or family history of mental illness.\n\n### "}, {"heading": "Paraphilic Disorders", "diagnosis": ["Unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder", "Alcohol use disorder", "Antisocial personality disorder", "Pedophilic disorder, nonexclusive type, sexually attracted to both"], "text": " Vance Orren was a 28-year-old self-reported cisgender heterosexual man who was\n\n arrested after pushing a stranger in front of an oncoming subway train. He told police\n\n that he believed the man was going to \u201ctell everyone that I was a faggot\u201d and that he, Mr.\n\n Orren, was trying to protect himself from the \u201chomosexual conspiracy.\u201d\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Mr. Orren had a history of a psychotic disorder, a cocaine use disorder, and\n\n nonadherence to medication and psychotherapy at the time of the incident. He was\n\n unemployed. In court, Mr. Orren entered a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease\n\n (the \u201cinsanity defense\u201d) and underwent a full psychiatric evaluation, including\n\n assessment of his sexual history and desires.\n\n As part of his legal case, Mr. Orren underwent a structured sex offender evaluation. He\n\n reported that his first sexual contact was at age 12, when his uncle and an 18-year-old\n\n male cousin \u201cdid things\u201d to him while he was in foster care. They would take him to\n\n McDonald\u2019s afterward, \u201cso it was fine.\u201d By the time he was 14 or 15, he was regularly\n\n having sex with males and females who ranged in age \u201cfrom about ten to in their\n\n thirties.\u201d\n\n He was unable to answer whether the sexual contact was always consensual, saying, \u201cNo\n\n one ever called the cops.\u201d As an adult, he said that he preferred having sex with \u201cyoung\n\n girls, because they don\u2019t fight much.\u201d He said that he usually only had sex with adults\n\n when he hired prostitutes or prostituted himself in exchange for money or drugs,\n\n although he said that sometimes when high, he \u201cmight have done stuff that I don\u2019t really\n\n remember.\u201d\n\n The structured sex offender evaluation included penile plethysmography, assessment of\n\n visual reaction time using Viewing Time (a measure of the amount of time a person looks\n\n at a particular photo or other visual representation of a sexually stimulating situation),\n\n and a detailed interview about his sexual practices. This evaluation concluded that his\n\n main sexual attraction was to girls between the ages of 8 and 13 years.\n\n Mr. Orren\u2019s personal history was significant for multiple childhood disruptions that led\n\n to his moving into the foster care system at age 7. At age 9, his first foster mother caught\n\n him repeatedly stealing toys and bullying other children. When she reprimanded him, he\n\n hit her with a brick, knocking her unconscious. That led to placement in a second foster\n\n home. He began using drugs and alcohol at age 11. He was first incarcerated at 13, for\n\n shoplifting from an electronics store in order to obtain money for marijuana. At that\n\n point, he went back to live with his maternal grandmother, who has episodically\n\n provided him a home since then. During those 15 years, he has been arrested at least a\n\n\n-----\n\n##### dozen times, mostly for drug possession.\n\n Mr. Orren stopped attending school in eighth grade, at about the same time that he was\n\n admitted to his first psychiatric inpatient unit. That admission was triggered by his\n\n beating his head against a wall \u201cto stop the voices.\u201d He was given a DSM-IV diagnosis of\n\n psychosis not otherwise specified, treated with risperidone, and discharged after 1 week.\n\n Soon after discharge, he discontinued the antipsychotic medication.\n\n Between the ages of 15 and 28, Mr. Orren regularly abused cocaine and alcohol and often\n\n used other substances when they were available. By the time of his arrest, he had had at\n\n least seven psychiatric admissions, always for auditory hallucinations and persecutory\n\n delusions (usually of a sexual nature). It was not clear which substances he was using\n\n prior to and during these episodes of psychosis or whether they were implicated in the\n\n development of his psychiatric symptoms. He had also been admitted twice for alcohol\n\n detoxification after he went into withdrawal while unable to acquire alcohol. He was\n\n consistently nonadherent to any type of outpatient treatment. He maintained sobriety\n\n only while in hospitals or jails. When contacted by the consulting psychiatrist, his\n\n grandmother pointed out that Mr. Orren had always been \u201creckless, dishonest, and\n\n angry. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard him apologize. I love him, but he probably belongs in\n\n jail for lots of reasons.\u201d\n\n### "}, {"heading": "Paraphilic Disorders", "diagnosis": ["Tobacco use disorder, mild"], "text": " Wallace Pickering was a 29-year-old man who presented for outpatient therapy with a\n\n chief complaint of \u201cI\u2019ve never been to a shrink before, but I just read DSM-5, and I have\n\n ten diagnoses, including six paraphilias, two personality disorders, a substance use\n\n disorder, and maybe something else.\u201d The patient described himself as an attorney who\n\n is \u201ca run-of-the-mill cisgender gay guy with a few kinks.\u201d He had been dating a former\n\n college classmate for the prior 2 years. A native of a mid-size city in the Midwest, Mr.\n\n Pickering was raised in a politically and religiously conservative household that included\n\n his parents and two younger siblings. Mr. Pickering\u2019s father and grandfather ran a\n\n prosperous business, and his family was very involved in their community. Mr. Pickering\n\n attended an elite college and law school. Since graduation, he had worked at a large law\n\n firm. He added that he was interested in his diagnoses at least partly because of his\n\n boyfriend, who was in his final year of training to be a psychiatrist.\n\n Mr. Pickering described his problems as being about \u201csex and drugs; I\u2019ve never cared\n\n much for rock and roll.\u201d Ever since high school, he described an interest in random\n\n\n-----\n\n##### sexual encounters. Not to be narcissistic though that s one of my diagnoses but I am\n\n kinda hot,\u201d he said, \u201cand I play it for what it\u2019s worth.\u201d This led him to frequent\n\n bathhouses and bars, where he could quickly connect to attractive, anonymous partners.\n\n He described feeling aroused when watching other people having sex and added that\n\n although he had quit the habit when he entered law school, he had previously gotten a\n\n thrill out of being watched while having sex. He said he had \u201chooked up\u201d about once a\n\n month since age 20. He said he had never once had unsafe sex with anyone aside from\n\n his boyfriend, and this led him to mention another of his \u201cdiagnoses\u201d: a fetishistic\n\n interest in rubber. He said condoms were great: they were virus proof, delayed\n\n ejaculation, and had an excellent smell. His interest in condoms had led him to get an\n\n outfit made entirely of rubber. He said it had been quite the hit at a bondage club, but it\n\n had made him so sweaty that he had worn it only once and had then thrown it away\n\n before his boyfriend found it. He mentioned that COVID had been isolating and terrible,\n\n but \u201cat least he got a chance to wear latex gloves out in public for a while, which was\n\n exciting in its way.\u201d\n\n He said he also enjoyed tying up his boyfriend during sex and feeling completely in\n\n control. He said he liked being a \u201csadistic top\u201d every month or two but added that he also\n\n sometimes liked being a \u201cbottom\u201d and at other times did not feel sexual at all.\n\n Mr. Pickering said that during his occasional pursuits of anonymous sex, he had a couple\n\n of \u201ctoxic habits.\u201d Whenever he went out partying, he would do a few lines of cocaine and\n\n drink about 4\u20136 beers. He said he always timed these \u201ctrips to the underworld\u201d for times\n\n when his boyfriend went out of town, and he would have time to recover. He added that\n\n withdrawing from cocaine \u201creally sucks\u201d for a day or two, adding that he probably has \u201ca\n\n mood disorder related to the cocaine withdrawal.\u201d\n\n He added that the planning had become more complicated and that he actually had\n\n probably only gone to a club twice in the prior year. Overall, his \u201csocial life is pretty\n\n boring. We have a lot of friends, but we\u2019re kinda like an old married couple. My only real\n\n vice is smoking. I have tried for years, but I haven\u2019t been able to get down below half a\n\n pack a day. Yawn.\u201d\n\n When asked to say more about himself, Mr. Pickering answered, \u201cRight . . . I almost\n\n\n-----\n\n##### forgot. I am obsessed by the hours that I work. I keep careful track so that I am among\n\n the top billers in the firm every month, and I always get my projects done on time, even\n\n if it means I don\u2019t sleep. My own theory is that it\u2019s part of my need to feel invulnerable\n\n and perfect despite being a mess on the inside.\u201d Mr. Pickering paused, smiled, and\n\n continued. \u201cThat made me wonder if I\u2019m obsessive-compulsive or narcissistic as well as\n\n having all the different paraphilias. Oh, and if hypersexuality is a diagnosis, then I\u2019m\n\n really screwed.\u201d\n\n Toward the end of the initial interview, the psychiatrist said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure if any of these\n\n behaviors are going to make it as a diagnosis, but I am very interested in how you feel.\u201d\n\n At that, Mr. Pickering welled up in tears and said he had felt sad and lonely all his life.\n\n He added that his family knew almost nothing about him, and that only a lesbian cousin\n\n \u2014who had also moved to New York\u2014knew that he was gay.\n\n On examination, Mr. Pickering was a well-groomed, attractive young man who was\n\n coherent and goal directed. He smiled readily but showed an appropriate affective range.\n\n He denied suicidality, confusion, and psychosis. He was cognitively very bright. His\n\n insight and judgment were viewed as intact.\n\n### "}]
